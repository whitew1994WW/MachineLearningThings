<p><span><span class="calibre5">I hadn’t realized the depth of my dependence on cookbooks until I noticed that my copy of Elizabeth David’s </span></span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">French Provincial Cooking</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre5"> had fingernail marks running below the recipes. Here was stark evidence of my timidity, an insistence on clinging to a set of instructions, like a handrail in the dark, when after twenty years of cooking I should surely have been well enough versed in the basics to let go and trust my instincts. Had I ever really learned to cook? Or was I just reasonably adept at following instructions? My mother, like her mother before her, is an excellent cook but owns only two recipe books and a scrapbook of clippings, and rarely consults even those. I began to suspect that the dozens of books </span></span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">I</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre5"> owned were both a symptom and a cause of my lack of kitchen confidence.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span class="calibre5">It was at a dinner around the same time that a friend served a dish using two ingredients it would never have occurred to me to pair. How, I wondered, did she know </span></span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">that</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre5"> would work? There was something in the air about surprising flavor matches, the kind of audacious combinations pioneered by chefs like Heston Blumenthal, Ferran Adrià and Grant Achatz. What lay at the heart of their approach to food was, as far as I could see, a deeper understanding of the links between flavors. Being an ordinary, if slightly obsessive, home cook, I didn’t have the equipment or resources to research these; what I needed was a manual, a primer to help me understand how and why one flavor might go with another, their points in common and their differences. Something like a thesaurus of flavors. But no such book existed and so, with what turned out in hindsight to be almost touching naivete, I thought I might try to compile one myself.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span class="calibre5"> </span></span></p>
<p><span><span class="calibre5">My first task was to draw up the list of flavors. Stopping at 99 was to some extent arbitrary. Nonetheless, a flavor thesaurus that accounted for every single flavor would be as impractical as it would be uncomfortable on the lap. Other than potatoes, the staple carbohydrates have been omitted. The same goes for most common condiments. There are, of course, plenty of interesting things to say about the flavors of rice, pasta, black pepper, vinegar and salt, but their flavor affinities are so wide as to exclude themselves by virtue of sheer compatibility. Other omissions, like zucchini, might strike you as odd: all I can say to the zucchini fan is (a) sorry, and (b) this book makes no claims to be the last word on the subject. Any book on flavor is going to be at least in part subjective, and in writing about the pairings I find most interesting or like to eat the most, I will inevitably have left gaps that come down to nothing other than a matter of taste.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span class="calibre5">The majority of flavors appear under their own heading. In a few instances, where it seemed to make sense, some very similarly flavored ingredients share a heading. Anise, for example, covers anise seeds, fennel, tarragon, licorice and pastis. Similarly, neither bacon and ham nor Brussels sprouts and cabbage could easily be separated, so they labor slightly uncomfortably under composite categories. When it came to a choice between untidiness and boring the reader with repetitions, I chose untidiness every time.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span class="calibre5">Then I sorted the flavors into categories. Most of us are familiar with the concept of flavor families, whether we know it or not. Floral, citrus, herbaceous: the sort of descriptors you might encounter on the back of a wine bottle, to help conjure an idea of how something might taste. And it’s into these, or adjectival headings like them, that the flavors are divided. The flavors in each family have certain qualities in common; in turn, each family is linked in some way to the one adjacent to it, so that, in sum, they comprise a sort of 360º spectrum, represented opposite as a flavor wheel.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span class="calibre5">Take the Citrusy family, for example. This covers zesty, citric flavors like orange, lemon and cardamom. Cardamom, in turn, has flavor compounds in common with rosemary, which is the first flavor in the next flavor family, Berry &amp; Bush. At the other end of that family, blackberry leads to the first flavor in the Floral Fruity family: raspberry. And so on around the wheel, flavor leading to flavor, family to family, in a developing sequence of relations you might enter at lemon and leave at blue cheese.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span class="calibre5">I acknowledge that this methodology has its limitations. Some flavors resisted easy categorization: coriander seed, for instance, ended up under Floral Fruity, but might as easily have sat in Citrusy or Spicy. And how an ingredient is prepared can make all the difference to its character. The flavor of cabbage, for example, is mustardy when raw, sulfurous cooked. The flavor wheel, in short, is by no means intended to be an inarguable, objective framework for understanding flavor—but it does provide a stimulating and intriguing means of navigating your way around the subject.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span class="calibre5">Next came the pairings. Clearly, dishes often have more than two primary ingredients, but a couple of considerations led me to make pairs of flavors the organizing principle of my </span></span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">Flavor Thesaurus</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre5">. First, sanity (mine). Even restricting myself to 99 flavors, if I had set out to write about flavor </span></span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">trios</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre5"> I would have been faced with 156,849 possible combinations; the 4,851 possible pairings seemed more to scale with the sort of book it would be both possible to write and pleasurable to read. Second, clarity. To assess, in the mind’s palate, the compatibility of two flavors is exponentially easier than imagining the interplay of three or more. Necessarily, I often discuss a flavor combination in the context of a dish that contains other ingredients (for example, parsley and mint in tabbouleh), but the emphasis is always on the main flavor pairing under discussion.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span class="calibre5">The entries elaborate on each of these pairings, drawing promiscuously on flavor science, history, culture, chefs’ wisdom and personal prejudice—anything that might shed light on why certain flavors work together, what they bring out in each other, how the same flavor pairings are expressed in different cuisines and so on. I’ve given any recipes in the briefest possible terms, rather in the manner of Victorian cookbooks—compressed in the expectation that you have some experience in the kitchen. If you’re tempted to cook anything in the pages that follow, it’s best to read the recipe through before you start (see Beet &amp; Pork, page 75, if you need convincing). I’ve assumed you know that you usually need to add salt to savory dishes, taste them and adjust before you serve, turn off the stove when you’re finished, and fish out any ingredients that might choke your loved ones. If something in a recipe isn’t clear—stop, think, and if the solution still isn’t forthcoming, find a similar recipe and see if that sheds any light.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span class="calibre5">Most often, I guarantee, the answer will just dawn on you. One of the great satisfactions of discovering more about flavor combinations is the confidence it gives you to strike out on your own. Following the instructions in a recipe is like parroting pre-formed sentences from a phrasebook. Forming an understanding of how flavors work together, on the other hand, is like learning the language: it allows you to express yourself freely, to improvise, to find appropriate substitutions for ingredients, to cook</span></span></p>
<p><span><span class="calibre5">a dish the way you fancy cooking it. You’ll be surprised how rarely things go seriously wrong. Although the author takes absolutely no responsibility for anything that ends up in the trash.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span class="calibre5"> </span></span></p>
<p><span><span class="calibre5">Flavor is, of course, notoriously subjective and hard to describe. Still, there are a few things worth noting before you try. As anyone who has been on a wine course will tell you, flavor is not the same as taste. Taste is restricted to five qualities detectable on the tongue and elsewhere in the mouth: sweetness, saltiness, sourness, bitterness and “umami” (or savoriness). Flavor, on the other hand, is detected mainly thanks to our sense of smell, by the olfactory bulb and, to a lesser extent, orally. Pinch your nose and you can tell if an ingredient is sweet or salty, but not what its flavor is. Your sense of taste gives you a back-of-an-envelope sketch of what a particular foodstuff is like: flavor fills in the details. Nonetheless, in its general, broadest use, the term “flavor” tends to incorporate taste, as well as the “trigeminal” qualities of ingredients—that is, the sensation of heat from chili, pepper and mustard, the cooling properties of menthol and the drawstring pucker of tannins in red wine and tea.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span class="calibre5">Beyond the basic taste elements, to characterize a flavor can be as elusive a task as describing any other sort of feeling. Inasmuch as the flavor of an ingredient is attributable to the chemical compounds it contains, we might with some degree of objectivity observe that two ingredients that share a compound have similar flavors. Holy basil and clove, for instance, both contain a compound called eugenol—and holy basil has a clove-like flavor. But what do we mean by a clove-like flavor? To me, it’s a bit like sucking on a sweet, rusty nail. However, no person’s taste buds, or olfactory systems, are quite the same, and neither are their faculties for converting sensory input into words.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span class="calibre5">Where you come from and what you’re accustomed to eating are also important determinants of how you sense and describe flavor, and of which flavors you tend to pair with others. I’ve used expert opinions to lend to my own judgments as robust an edge of objectivity as possible. But there’s no escaping the fact everyone’s flavor thesaurus would to some extent be different. Flavor is, among other things, a repository of feeling and memory: just as smell is said to be the most redolent sense, so the flavor of a certain dish can transport us back instantaneously to the time and place we first experienced it, or experienced it most memorably. </span></span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">The</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre5"> </span></span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">Flavor Thesaurus</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre5"> may look like, and even sometimes read like, a reference book, but for all its factual content it’s an inescapably subjective one.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span class="calibre5"> </span></span></p>
<p><span><span class="calibre5">Writing </span></span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">The Flavor Thesaurus </span></span></span><span><span class="calibre5">has taught me many things, not least to take a more open-minded approach to combinations that other cooks, in other cultures, take for granted. But as a naturally untidy person, I’m always looking for patterns, some means of imposing order on unruly reality. And in part I suppose I expected the book to add up, over its length, to something along these lines, a Grand Unifying Flavor Theory that would reconcile the science with the poetry and my mother’s thoughts on jam.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span class="calibre5">It didn’t. Or not quite. I </span></span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">did</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre5"> learn some broadly applicable principles, like how to use one flavor to disguise, bolster, temper or enliven another. And I’m now far more alert to the importance of balancing tastes—salt, sweet, bitter, sour and umami—and making the most of contrasting textures and temperatures. But what </span></span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">The</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre5"> </span></span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">Flavor Thesaurus</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre5"> does add up to, in the end, is a patchwork of facts, connections, impressions and recollections, designed less to tell you exactly what to do than to provide the spark for your own recipe or adaptation. It’s there, in short, to get the juices flowing.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span class="calibre5">The complex processing undergone by most chocolate explains the huge variation in flavor. The untreated cocoa beans are astringent and bitter but fermentation gives rise to fruity, wine-like or sherry flavors, and the roasting process can introduce a nearly infinite variety of nutty, earthy, woody, flowery and spicy notes. The flavor of good-quality chocolate is best appreciated by pushing a piece to the roof of your mouth and letting it melt. The more sweetened the chocolate, the quicker it will reveal its flavor. As you work your way up the cocoa percentages you’ll notice that it takes longer for the flavor to develop, and that there’s an increase in bitterness and length—the time the flavor lingers in your mouth. When you get to 99 or 100 percent cocoa content, you may also note that the experience is like running your tongue along the main London–Edinburgh railway. In this section, “chocolate” is taken to cover dark chocolate, milk chocolate and cocoa. White chocolate is dealt with separately <a href="#dummy_split_022.html#filepos1603125">*</a>.</span></span></p>

Chocolate and almond, the ingredients in the Toblerone your dad grabbed at the airport instead of a pair of maracas or a genuine bear’s paw. The secret of its success must have something to do with the genial compatibility of chocolate and almond. A wealth of nutty flavor notes is formed when cocoa beans are roasted during the chocolate-making process. Similarly, the flavor of almonds is intensified by toasting, which helps them stand up to chocolate’s strength of flavor. Put this to the test in Christopher Tan’s chocolate soup with salted almonds. Melt 1 tbsp unsalted butter in a skillet over a medium-low heat, add 1½ oz sliced almonds and sauté with care for 4–5 minutes, until golden brown. Set aside. Whisk 8 fl oz water, 3 fl oz whipping cream, 1 oz superfine sugar and 1¼ oz sifted cocoa powder in a saucepan over a medium-low heat until the sugar has dissolved. Let the mixture bubble gently for 2–3 minutes, then add 3½ oz chopped dark chocolate containing at least 60 percent cocoa solids. Stir with the whisk until smooth, then pour into little bowls, top with the almonds and sprinkle over a few grains of </span></span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">fleur de sel</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre5">.

She says she was inspired by eating chocolate-chip pancakes with maple syrup and bacon when she was six. You might see how the classic combination of savory and sweet would work and be made that bit more unusual by the smoky element in the bacon. Taking the combination a step farther, Tee and Cakes in Boulder, Colorado, makes maple-flavored cupcakes topped with a slightly salted dark chocolate ganache and a sprinkle of chopped-up bacon.</span></span></p>

Use the cardamom in sufficient quantities and you can pick out its enigmatic citrus, eucalyptus and warm, woody-floral qualities. I find adding a pinch of ground cardamom can make even the most ordinary dark chocolate taste expensive. This tart is spectacularly delicious and very quick to make but needs a couple of hours in the fridge to set. Prepare and bake a 9-in sweet pastry shell. Slit open 10 cardamom pods, grind up the contents with a mortar and pestle, add to 1¼ cups heavy cream in a pan and scald. Remove from the heat and add 7 oz dark chocolate, broken into pieces, and 2 tbsp unsalted butter. Stir until melted and well mixed. When cooled a little (don’t let it set), pour into the pastry shell and place in the fridge for two or three hours. When it has hardened, sift a little cocoa powder over it and serve with a modest dollop of crème fraîche.</span></span></p>

Tempting, perhaps, to make these and bury them in a deep soil of finely grated chocolate, then let your guests dig for the potatoes with spoons. For fear of friends thinking you’ve lost it completely, a chocolate sauce on a chestnut ice cream would be tasty, if less fun. If you’re on a chestnut bender, use the egg whites left over from making the ice cream to make a Mont Blanc, the classic dessert of meringue topped with a mound of sweetened chestnut purée, a summit of whipped cream and a light dusting of confectioners’ sugar.</span></span></p>

As chilies turn red, they develop a sweet, fruity flavor that combines harmoniously with bitter chocolate—even more so when the chili is dried and has taken on still sweeter, raisiny, leathery notes. Look out for mulato and ancho dried chilies, which are considered inherently chocolatey themselves. Besides flavor compatibility, the fattiness of chocolate offsets some of the chili heat, as in a chili-rich Mexican </span></span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">mole</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre5">. </span></span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">Mole</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre5"> simply means “sauce,” and there are many different types. Most of them contain dried chilies, but as a rule chocolate turns up only in “red” or “black” </span></span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">moles</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre5">. As well as chili and chocolate, these contain various dried fruits, bread, nuts, tomato, onion, garlic, seeds, dried and fresh herbs, spices, oil, lard and stock. As you might imagine, the result is a complex, sweet-piquant sauce that requires much pounding, grinding and toasting to prepare. Incidentally, the meat is either browned and added to the sauce to finish cooking, or cooked (usually roasted) separately and served with the sauce draped over it. Fresh </span></span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">moles</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre5"> are primarily confined to special occasions. If you fancy making one to an authentic recipe but don’t have Mexican chocolate (which is coarse, dark and often blended with cinnamon and vanilla), the cookbook writer Rick Bayless suggests using a third as much unsweetened cocoa powder instead. Aside from </span></span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">moles</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre5">, American spice shops sell prepared blends of cocoa, chipotle and paprika to add to chili con carne, stews or even cakes and brownies. You might also try adding a few pinches of dried red chili flakes to chocolate cornflake clusters—I call these mini Krakatoa cakes. The corn flavor is very harmonious with the chili and chocolate, and the crunchy texture adds to the fun. Get the basic recipe from a five-year-old. But best not to serve him or her the results.</span></span></p>

If, as I’d been led to believe, the cigarette companies were so dastardly, why didn’t they learn something from the candy companies and make their products irresistible?

If you’re looking for a hit, try Pralus’s Tanzanie (tobacco, treacle, molasses, raisin) or their Vanuatu (smoke, spice, licorice). For a chocolate with notes of tobacco and coconut, try Michel Cluizel’s Mangaro Lait 50%, a milk chocolate that, as the name suggests, contains a whopping 50 percent cocoa.</span></span></p>

In the 1940s mothers would cut a slice off the loaf, put it between slices of bread and give it to their children, who were smart enough to throw away the bread and just eat the chocolate. Piedmontese ducks must have been very fantastically plump mid-century.

He goes on to note that they took advantage of this flavor harmony by mixing small amounts of expensive cocoa into a peanut mixture to make a sort of cheap chocolate. Fifty years later, in 1912, the Goo Goo Cluster, a mixture of chocolate, peanuts, caramel and marshmallow, became the first combination chocolate bar in the U.S. By the close of the 1920s, Reese’s and Mars had respectively launched Peanut Butter Cups and Snickers, the latter becoming America’s favorite chocolate bar, a position it holds to this day. Unroasted peanuts actually don’t taste very good with chocolate, since (being legumes) they have a greenish, vegetal taste; the success of most peanut-chocolate combinations is down to the formation of pyrazines during the roasting process, which are harmonious with roasted notes in the chocolate. Use the combination at home for diner-style treats like a sundae made with vanilla ice cream topped with chopped, roasted peanuts and chocolate sauce, or a milkshake made with liquefied peanut butter and chocolate ice cream. Chef Paul Heathcote uses dark chocolate instead of the usual milk in his salty chocolate, caramel and peanut tart.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span class="calibre5">Like chocolate, coffee goes through multiple stages before it reaches the cup, which accounts for its complexity. More than 800 aroma compounds have been identified in the roasted bean. Raw, the green seed is a relatively unfragrant little thing. Roasting expands it by 50 to 100 percent and, in turning it brown, releases its flavor. As a rule, lighter-brown beans (roasted for 9–11 minutes) are truer to their origins—i.e., they reveal more about the variety of bean and its growing conditions. When a coffee is darker (12–13 minutes’ roasting time) and oily on its surface, roasted flavors will have begun to dominate, and it’ll be spicier and more chocolatey. Coffee might contain notes of black currant, coriander seed, clove, vanilla, chocolate and nuts, all of which make harmonious matches, and are used to flavor the kinds of syrup you find in coffee bars. Tia Maria and Kahlua are both coffee-flavored liqueurs but have markedly different characters.</span></span></p>

Walnut (see Coffee &amp; Walnut, <a href="#dummy_split_007.html#filepos67445">*</a>) is the most common nut note identified in coffee but almond (or marzipan) is also typical. Even if you don’t detect almonds in your cup of joe, it’ll still work a treat with a plump almond croissant covered with a generous dusting of confectioners’ sugar. French women seem to be able to eat these without looking as if they’ve been caught in a snowstorm. I can’t.</span></span></p>

It’s also been spotted in fancier restaurants, perhaps because there’s a well-reported flavor overlap between roasted coffee and cooked beef. But my experience suggests it’s a shotgun wedding. I tried a coffee marinade on a steak and found it gave the meat an overpoweringly gamy flavor. Best to keep these at least one course apart at dinner.</span></span></p>

You could even make it with this orange and coffee-bean liqueur. The recipe is adapted from one by Patricia Wells, who originally used eau de vie. I rather like the way, with marvelously arbitrary bossiness, it calls for 44 coffee beans, no more and no less. Take a large orange and make 44 slits in it. Put a coffee bean in each. It will now look like a medieval weapon or tribal fetish. Put 44 sugar cubes in a jar. Position the orange on top and pour over 2 cups brandy, rum or vodka. Leave it to steep for 44 days, then squeeze the juice out of the orange, mix it back into the alcohol, strain and pour into a sterilized bottle. Alternatively, put it somewhere dark and cool, forget about it completely, find it covered in dust something like 444 days later, try it skeptically, and realize on your second sip that it’s absolutely delicious without the addition of the juice. Perfectly balanced, not too sweet, and with a complex lingering coffee/orange flavor that proves to be as good at rounding off a day as it is at starting one.</span></span></p>

Ground into peanut butter, the flavor becomes sweeter and saltier with a pleasing edge of bitterness.

Cut 2 chicken breasts into half-inch squares and place in a mixture of 1 tbsp light soy sauce, 2 tsp Shaoxing wine, 2 tsp cornstarch and ½ tsp salt.

Roast 12/3 cups skinned peanuts in the oven at 375°F for 6–8 minutes. Cool, then whiz in a food processor until finely ground. Add 3 tbsp soy sauce, 2 tbsp brown sugar, the juice of ½ lime, a couple of crushed garlic cloves (fried with 2–3 chopped shallots) and chili to taste. Whiz until smooth, add 1½ cups coconut milk and whiz again until all is well combined. Use this to dress a combination of cooked, blanched and raw vegetables. Cooled cooked potato, blanched green beans and raw bean sprouts are a common combination, variously supplemented with carrot, scallions, cabbage, cucumber or lettuce. Boiled eggs, shrimp chips, fried onion or tofu are used as a garnish. The dressing can be frozen.</span></span></p>

Add about 2 lb meat, jointed or cut into chunks, and allow to brown. Empty in a can of tomatoes, 2 tbsp tomato purée, a bay leaf, and ½ cup peanut butter whisked into 2 cups hot water or stock. Simmer for about an hour, then add a green bell pepper and some root vegetables (carrot, sweet potato, squash, yam—say about 4 large carrots’ worth), chopped into bite-sized pieces. Continue to simmer until they’re just tender. Give it a good stir and serve on rice, couscous or the more traditional millet.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span class="calibre5">Chicken has a reputation for being bland—the magnolia of foods—and yet standing up to 40 cloves of garlic (see Garlic &amp; Chicken, <a href="#dummy_split_012.html#filepos492554">*</a>), or to big flavors like rosemary, thyme and lemon, takes some serious meatiness. The well-exercised joints—legs, thighs—are the tastiest, even more so when cooked skin-on and bone-in. It’s the skinless, boneless breast meat, especially from intensively farmed birds, that has earned chicken its pale reputation. It’s like a sort of dry tofu for carnivores. The best that can be said of it is that it adds bite to dishes and doesn’t get in the way of more interesting flavors in a sauce—salty, sweet, nutty, fruity, spicy, even fishy. This chapter also touches on turkey, goose, quail and the odd game bird. And swan.</span></span></p>

Seed 6–8 peppers (red, yellow or orange, not green), chop them into generous chunks and put in a large non-stick saucepan with 8 chicken thighs, skin-on and preferably bone-in too. Leave over a medium heat. Keep an eye on it for the first ten minutes, giving it the odd stir to prevent it sticking. Then all of a sudden the peppers release their juices and you can leave it alone. Put a lid on and cook over a low-medium heat for 30 minutes, or until the pan is half-full of sweet, oily, autumn-colored stock. It’s a bit of a miracle, this—you can hardly believe the rich complexity of the sauce comes from just two ingredients. Season and serve with rice, couscous or French bread, whichever you prefer to mop up with.</span></span></p>

Deglaze the pan with 1¼ cups dry white wine and 2 tbsp strong mustard. Pour this sauce over the chicken in an ovenproof dish and bake for 40 minutes at 400°F, turning a few times.

Chicken of the woods, </span></span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">Laetiporus sulphureus</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre5">, which looks more like a flattened chicken nugget than anything, is perhaps the closest to actual chicken in texture, but opinion is divided as to whether the flavor bears much comparison. Add a handful or two of mushrooms to the pot with your chicken and they will contribute a gamy flavor that makes the bird taste as if it really did come from the woods, as opposed to the middle shelf of your refrigerator. Add them to a braising pheasant or partridge and you’ll almost be able to hear the twigs snap underfoot. The pairing of morels with chicken in a cream sauce is altogether less rustic; morels are often said to be closer to truffles in their complexity and refinement of flavor. Like truffles, they come in white and black forms, both of which the late American food writer Richard Olney thought were “exquisite.” He added that while dried morels have their uses in sauces and terrines, they can never quite measure up to fresh. The general feeling is that the drying process robs morels of some of their honeyed sweetness. Fresh or dried, black or white, morels must be cooked.</span></span></p>

The pear pieces absorb the rich cooking liquid but retain their subtle, fruity sweetness. For a Christmastime dinner, heat 1 tbsp oil in a hefty casserole and brown 4 small partridges. Set the birds aside and in the same pan cook about 5 oz chopped smoked bacon with 2 tbsp butter, 20 peeled whole shallots, 4 peeled, cored and quartered pears and a chopped garlic clove. When the shallots are golden and softened, return the partridges to the pan and pour over 2/3 cup hot chicken stock. Season, cover, and cook in the oven at 325°F for 20–25 minutes. You can serve this straight from the pot, but it’s better to remove the partridges and rest them under foil while you put the casserole back on the heat and stir in 7 oz cooked, peeled chestnuts until they’re warmed through.

Strolling along the rue Aubernon, I was stopped in my tracks by a bizarrely beautiful contraption of black iron and brass, like one of Jean Tinguely’s creaking kinetic sculptures, except it smelled of roast chicken. Rows of birds levitated in different stages of readiness, goosebump-raw to bronzed, reaching the top of their elliptical cycle before gravity turned the skewer and the birds adjusted to the downward part of their journey, with a jolt that shook free molten droplets of fat. The machine had a similarly hypnotic effect to the Penny Falls in amusement arcades, as if by pushing a raw chicken into a slot at the top a cooked one might be displaced into the tray at the bottom. In fact the tray at the bottom was full of potato chips. Could there be anything more delicious in the world? Chicken and roast potatoes, maybe, or Portuguese-style chicken and fries, but there was something particularly irresistible about the chips from the bottom of the rotisserie, chewy and glisteningly coated in the fat dripping from the chickens above.</span></span></p>

If you subscribe to this view, you might find chicken an acceptable substitute in quail dishes that call for sauce; many cooks do. The psychologists Hollingworth and Poffenberger claim that with “tactual” qualities eliminated, most people fail to distinguish between the flavors of chicken, turkey and quail. But tactual qualities are not to be sniffed at. Would Gertrudis have had such a good time chomping through a skinless chicken breast as gnawing on a sticky little quail’s leg?</span></span></p>

Goose stuffed with sage and onion and served with applesauce was the classic Christmas dish in the UK from the reign of Elizabeth I to the Second World War, although by the end of the Victorian era most people, particularly in the south of England, had switched to turkey. Victoria herself didn’t care for either bird, preferring beef or a bit of roast swan. If you’re curious, Peter Gladwin, once chef to Elizabeth II, compares swan’s dark, tough meat to undernourished goose.</span></span></p>

Brining a chicken before roasting it, however, makes the meat juicier and lend an extra intensity of flavor, not only because the salt penetrates the meat but because the brine can be flavored with herbs, spices and/or vegetables. Put about 2½ oz sea salt and ¼ cup sugar in a pan with 2 cups of water and a dozen sprigs of thyme (or 1 tbsp dried thyme), heat gently till dissolved, then leave to cool. Add 6 cups of cold water to the salt water and refrigerate. When the brine is good and cold, wash the chicken and put it in a large roasting bag, big enough both to hold it and to immerse it totally in brine. Pour in the brine, then seal the bag, smoothing out as much of the air as possible. Leave in the fridge for 4–8 hours, moving it around from time to time. Give the chicken a thorough rinse in cold water before patting it dry. It can then be roasted as normal, immediately or after a day or two left covered in the fridge.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span class="calibre5">Despite its prohibition by two of the major religions, pork is the world’s most consumed meat. It tastes less salty and somewhat sweeter than beef. When roasted, good pork contains a tantalizing combination of woodland and farmyard flavors, which can be emphasized with garlic, mushrooms, cabbage, potatoes and robust herbs or contrasted with the sharp flavor of apple. Sweet anise, white pepper and cooked onions all tease out its savory meatiness. Remember that the color of meat is an indicator of how much exercise the animal has been allowed; when raw, fully flavored pork will therefore be a healthy rose pink. If it’s the color of a student’s dishcloth, it will undoubtedly have seen as much action.</span></span></p>

In the United States, you can buy the trio premixed, often in equal measures, in the form of meatloaf or meatball mix. The flavor and texture of a beef stew can be enriched by the addition of pork rind—hold a little back when you’re roasting a pork joint, even if that means less crackling.

Some people say it’s more mustardy and spicy than standard broccoli; I’d add that it has a ferrous tang and a salty hint of licorice. And with those hot and anise-like qualities, it’s just perfect with Italian pork sausages (often flavored with chili and fennel seeds themselves). There are several ways to cook this dish. Sometimes the broccoli is cooked with the pasta, or everything is thrown into the same pan together. Some recipes stipulate that the sausages should be kept whole, others that the meat should be liberated from the casings, others still that the sausages be sliced into bite-sized pieces. I favor the last method, cooking the pieces slowly in olive oil. When some of the fat has rendered, I add chopped broccoli and cook it with the sausage pieces for 15–20 minutes. A tablespoon of hot pasta cooking water can be added to the sauce now and then to create a brothy juice that’s soaked up by the florets. Serve with orecchiette pasta, so that, properly mixed into the sauce, the “little ears” of pasta fill up with the broccoli’s tiny green flower buds like miniature salad bowls.</span></span></p>

Maybe it’s the Pop Art neatness that appeals, as I feel the same way about Scotch eggs. Good examples of either are hard to find. Best to make your own. For 4 Scotch eggs, mince together about 7 oz pork shoulder and 3 oz unsmoked streaky bacon and season. Divide into 4 and, with wet hands, form into balls and then into cups. Dust 4 peeled boiled eggs with flour and sit the fat end of each in a “cup.” Work the meat around the egg, making sure there are no holes. Dip in beaten egg, then breadcrumbs and deep-fry for 7–8 minutes, turning a few times for even color. Little Scotch quail’s eggs are a brilliant variation, but only if someone else is peeling the shells off.

Fold the leeks into the potato with a generous pinch of mustard powder and a shake of white pepper. Finally mix in about 6 oz crumbled black pudding. Wet your hands and shape the mixture into 6–8 patties. If there’s time, it’s best to let them rest in the fridge for at least half an hour—this stops them breaking up in the pan. Lightly dust the patties with flour, then shallow-fry till they are thoroughly heated through (the pudding is already cooked) and tantalizingly browned on each side. Serve with spinach salad in a mustardy dressing, plus a glass of ale.</span></span></p>

<div class="calibre21">
 
</div>
<p><span><span class="calibre5">Liver has a recognizable flavor across animal species. Both its intensity of flavor and its level of tenderness or toughness depend to some extent on the animal’s age, which is why calf’s and lamb’s liver are generally favored over ox liver. That said, a well-reared, grass-fed cow will usually furnish superior liver to that of an ill-kept calf pumped full of antibiotics. The liver is the clearinghouse for the body’s toxins, and an animal that has experienced a lot of stress will have had to metabolize more compounds that detract from the ultimate eating quality of the meat.</span></span></p>

The liver is one of the few places in a mammal’s or bird’s body where a large amount of liquid blood collects. So it’s perhaps not surprising that apple, which goes so well with rich, delicate blood sausage, should go well with liver too. In mainland Europe, poultry liver and apple are combined in mousses, pâtés and terrines.</span></span></p>

Fry your slices of bacon until crisp and set them aside somewhere hot while you quickly fry the liver in the bacon fat. Calf’s liver is often served with bacon in restaurants, but lamb’s liver can be excellent too. If you’re worried that the liver might be too strongly flavored, you can soak it in milk (as some do with anchovies) for an hour or so before cooking, remembering to pat it dry. And bear in mind that, like cabbage and eggs, liver’s flavor intensifies with longer cooking.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span class="calibre5">The taste of beef is predominantly salty and umami-ish, with some sweetness and sourness (and bitterness if the meat is rare). Its flavor is clean, yeasty and meaty, with a slight metallic edge, and little of the animalic character so apparent in most pork and lamb. As with all meat, the flavor will to some extent depend on the species, how the animal has been reared, the cut and the cooking method. Grass-fed beef is fuller flavored than grain-fed. Most beef benefits from hanging, which gives it a deeper, gamier flavor. Beef works well with vegetables and shellfish, as do other meats, but it has a particular affinity for sharp flavors, notably horseradish and mustard.</span></span></p>

The dish is said to have originated in San Antonio, Texas, in the late nineteenth century, when it was sold from cauldrons under lamplight by the famous “chili queens.” Health and Safety did for them in the 1940s, but at heart chili (or at least a “bowl of red”) still belongs to Texas. There is a predictably high level of debate about what constitutes an authentic chili, but most recipes are agreed on a spice mix of dried powdered chili, cumin and oregano. The pepper of choice is the smoky, dried ancho, with a blast of extra heat supplied by the infernal cayenne. An altogether different take on this pairing comes in the form of weeping tiger salad from Thailand, in which seared beef steak is served on a crisp salad with a chili, lime and fish sauce dressing.</span></span></p>

Beef and mushroom are also paired in a stroganoff, or in a pie with a thick, booze-laced gravy. A few years ago, at the Fence Gate Inn in Burnley, Lancashire, the chef, Spencer Burge, caused a fuss by making a beef and mushroom pie that cost £1,000 (about $1,500) a slice. It consisted of 5 lb wagyu beef, 3 lb rare, cinnamon-scented Japanese </span></span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">matsutake</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre5"> mushrooms (so precious they were picked under the protection of an armed guard), black truffle, and that favorite ingredient of the honest British pie, gold leaf. Most connoisseurs recommend eating wagyu raw or rare truly to appreciate its quality.

To lend piquancy, a little anchovy and garlic, mixed to a paste with some of the cooking juices, is sometimes added in the last 15 minutes of cooking. And if you’ve ever tasted French onion soup made with veal stock, you’ll never want it any other way.</span></span></p>

At high, Formica-topped tables drivers sat hunkered over their food, staring at us like dogs drowsily protective of their bones. There was no menu, and as the staff didn’t seem to speak much English—or speak much at all—there was nothing for it but to point at what we wanted. It wasn’t long before we, too, were hunched over our food, just as jealous of it as the wordless </span></span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">routiers</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre5"> patting flakes of pastry off their stomachs. Thin layers of rutabaga, turnip and potato lined the bottom of the casing; above that, a generous pile of tender beef, seasoned as it should be with white pepper. And just below the pastry lid lay a seam of soft onions, whose juice had seeped through the meat, tenderizing it all the way through to the strata of vegetables, so the whole pie was steeped in a tangy, earthy sweetness that set off the robust savoriness of the meat. So simple, yet so sensitive to the ingredients. Were we at a simply wonderful, if (thankfully!) little-known, Relais Routiers somewhere between Normandy and Burgundy? No, we were in a gas station off the A390 in Cornwall. We followed our Cornish pasties with the most marvelous pouch of Maltesers.</span></span></p>

We nagged for orange-crumbed fish fingers, level as mantelpieces, and sawdusty cakes in lurid icing. When the Pot Noodle (like Cup Noodles in the United States) launched in the 1970s, I pestered and pestered until my mother gave in. One Beef and Tomato Pot Noodle was procured from the corner shop and the entire family huddled round, as a generation back they might have round an early television, to peer into the cup and witness the alchemical transformation from fish food into a hot meal. Mixing up the noodles, soy-based meat substitute, freeze-dried vegetables and bouillon powder with a sachet of tomato ketchup beat my mother’s spaghetti bolognese hands down for entertainment value but offered an eating experience whose weirdly one-dimensional inauthenticity I dimly understood was half the point: a sort of slippery soup that tasted of barbecue-beef-flavor chips.</span></span></p>

Tournedos Rossini calls for perfectly cooked steak and a slice of foie gras, served on a crouton with Madeira sauce. Black truffle is shaved over the top and usually added to the sauce too. The Italians might shave a little white truffle—which doesn’t tolerate being cooked—over a plate of carpaccio. No frills or furbelows: they just let the ingredients speak for themselves.</span></span></p>

They’re preserved in vinegar when the nut is still green, before the shell has formed. If you’re making your own, this means gathering the nuts in summer. They’re lovely things: black as crude oil, with a slight beet-like resistance to the teeth, a mild piquancy and a flavor only subtly reminiscent of unpickled walnuts. They’re frequently paired with Christmas foods—cold roast beef, blue cheese or leftover turkey. Chef Fergus Henderson makes a beef stew with pickled walnuts, cooked in red wine with lots of red onion, garlic, herbs and rich stock.</span></span></p>

<div class="calibre21">

<p><span><span class="calibre5">In the United States, lamb comes bottom of the flavor-preference table, behind beef, chicken, fish, pork, turkey and veal. Per capita consumption is only 1 percent that of beef or chicken. The flavor, even of young lamb, is considered by many to be too sheepy and gamy, and the use of flavor descriptors like “sweaty-sour” is enough to make anyone pause before taking a fork to a heavenly, subsiding lamb shank. The characteristic flavor is primarily in the fat—in blind tastings, many people find it hard to distinguish the flavors of very lean lamb and beef—and improves with hanging, even in the case of young lamb. Mutton, for its part, not only develops a deeper flavor when hung for two or three weeks but becomes tender enough to roast. One of the great pleasures of full-flavored lamb is its ability to stand up to other strong flavors—robust herbs such as rosemary, for example, or bold spices in curries and stews.</span></span></p>

Scale down the Moroccan tradition of stuffing whole lambs with rice, spices and almonds to your humbler requirements by using a boned shoulder of lamb. Alternatively, pair lamb and almonds in a slow-cooked tagine. Or try my Moroccan-style lamb meatballs, cooked with spiced rice and garnished with toasted almonds, which boasts similarly fine flavors to a tagine but can be made in minutes rather than hours. Slowly soften an onion in oil and a little butter with a cinnamon stick. Meanwhile, mix 2 tsp allspice into 1 lb minced lamb. Season and form into walnut-sized balls. Steep a pinch of saffron threads in hot water. When the onion is soft, add 3 cups hot water, 2 tsp honey, 2 tsp pomegranate molasses, 2 tsp allspice, 1 tsp salt and the saffron water, then bring to the boil. Add the meatballs. When the water starts to bubble again, add 1 cup basmati rice, stir and simmer, covered, for 10 minutes. Check for seasoning and the rice’s texture—you don’t want it to turn mushy. When the rice is just cooked, stir in 6 tbsp chopped parsley, 3 tbsp chopped mint and a drained can of chickpeas. Heat through and serve with lots of toasted almond slivers and a little more chopped parsley or mint. This is, in essence, a thick soup, so needs no other accompaniment.</span></span></p>

Anchovy works as a flavor enhancer for the meat. All you have to do is stick a knife into a shoulder or leg joint at various intervals, then push drained salted anchovies into the slits. I tend to use 8–12 anchovies for a 4 lb joint. You can always make more slits and press in some garlic and/or rosemary too—all feisty flavors that rub along very nicely together. Roast the lamb in the usual way. The anchovy melts into the meat and intensifies the flavor with a mouthwateringly rich, savory saltiness, and the gravy should be terrific.</span></span></p>

And Pernod gives a warm breeze of anise to this summery lamb dish. Soften a diced onion and a little garlic in olive oil. Add 8 lamb loin chops dusted with seasoned flour and cook until browned. Add 3 tbsp Pernod and allow to cook over a high heat for 1 minute. Then add 3 small zucchini, cut into coins, and a can of peeled plum tomatoes, chopping them up in the pan with a spoon. Stir in some seasoning, 1 tsp herbes  de Provence and 1 tbsp tomato purée. Bring to the boil, then simmer, covered, for 45 minutes, giving the odd stir. Serve with saffron rice or couscous.</span></span></p>

Meanwhile, the musky, rich apricots plump up with lamb stock, cinnamon, coriander and cumin, so by the time the dish is served they’re neither too cloying nor too fruity. You might also pair apricot with lamb in a similarly spiced pilaf, or stuff lamb with a mixture of chopped dried apricots, onion, almonds and rice or couscous.</span></span></p>

A rich mutton and potato stew with sour cherries is made in Azerbaijan, while in Turkey you might find sour cherries and lamb in a pilaf accompanied by any combination of onions, saffron, almonds, pomegranate, feta, mint, parsley and pistachios.</span></span></p>

In 1747 Hannah Glasse wrote that a roasted, skinned hindquarter of pork will eat like lamb if served with mint sauce, which must have more to do with the overpowering nature of the sauce than any true similarity between the meats. But mint as a partner for lamb should not be dismissed wholesale. Lamb has a natural affinity for herbal flavors and, like citrus, mint’s cleansing properties serve the useful purpose of deodorizing some of lamb’s funkier notes. Consider, for example, the lamb and mint ravioli served at Mario Batali’s Babbo restaurant in New York. Or </span></span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">sauce paloise</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre5">, which is like Béarnaise but swaps the tarragon for mint and is served with roast or grilled lamb.

Of all meats, lamb is the easiest to identify by cooking fragrance alone, as the meat contains chains of fatty acids not found in chicken, beef or pork. And haggis is intensely lamby. It’s made from the “pluck”—the animal’s liver, heart and lungs—mixed with oatmeal, suet, pepper, allspice, clove and nutmeg. Neeps (rutabaga) and tatties (mashed potatoes) are the essential side dish. The peppery sweetness of the neeps chimes with the haggis’s own spiciness, and makes the meal worthy of its arrival to a flourish of bagpipes.

<p><span><span class="calibre5">The flavors in goat cheese range from the lightest and most citric to the fullest Billy Goat Gruff. Its sharpness works well with sweet, dense ingredients like beets, butternut squash, good bread and honey. Traditionally feta and halloumi are made with sheep’s milk, or a combination of sheep and goat’s milk. They are included in this chapter because they share many flavor affinities with goat cheese. Like all cheeses, the flavor of goat cheese is markedly influenced by what the animal has eaten. In a sensory evaluation study conducted in 2001, over two-thirds of the tasting panel correctly identified which one-day-old goat cheese had come from pasture-grazed goats and which from animals fed on hay and concentrate. For the twenty-day-old cheese, the figure rose to 100 percent.</span></span></p>

Young, we kicked off with a ten-day-old Cerney, a goat cheese from Gloucestershire, paired with an Amedei 63 percent cocoa dark chocolate, moving on to a matured version of the same cheese with a 64 percent Valrhona Madagascan Manjari. Chocolate with cheese may sound an unlikely, even offputting, proposition, until it strikes you how comparable it is to chocolate and milk (or cream) and, further, how the flavor notes in some good chocolate—spicy berry fruits, dried fruits, caramels—are natural partners for cheese. We also tried Colston Bassett Stilton with Valrhona 70 percent, following the precedent of Young’s Stilton and port truffles, which were originally conceived as a seasonal special but proved so popular that they’re now on the menu year-round. But the revelation of the night was the pairing of Milleen’s, a deliciously piquant, floral washed-rind Irish cheese made from cow’s milk, first rind-on with an 85 percent Valrhona African, then rind-off with a Valrhona 40 percent Java milk chocolate. Try adding a few types of chocolate to your cheeseboard at the end of a meal—if your guests really can’t face combining chocolate and cheese, they can always eat them separately. And both will work with port.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span class="calibre5">Washing cheese in brine and other solutions dates back to the Middle Ages, when European monks discovered that the practice stimulated the growth of bacteria, which gave the cheese less acidic, more pungent flavors, thus making abstention from meat a lot more bearable. In research conducted at Cranfield University in the UK, the beery washed-rind Vieux Boulogne was declared the world’s smelliest cheese, outstinking even brandy-washed Époisses, which is banned on public transportation in France. As a rule, washed-rind cheeses are best left in the quiet company of bread or crackers, but they also go well with ingredients that share their piquant spiciness (like cumin, sharp apples or raw onion) or their soft earthiness (like potato). This chapter covers Stinking Bishop, Munster, Pont L’Évêque, Langres, Livarot, Vacherin and Celtic Promise.</span></span></p>

Slice or scoop your cheese onto these thin fennel-seed crackers. Sift 1 cup plain flour into a bowl with ½ tsp baking powder, ½ tsp salt and 2 tsp fennel seeds. Add 1½ tbsp olive oil and ½ cup water in increments until the mixture is wet enough for a dough to be formed. Knead for 5 minutes, roll out to roughly ¼ in thick, and press out your crackers with a biscuit cutter. You’ll get about 24 crackers of 2-in diameter. Place on a greased baking sheet, brush with water and cook for 25 minutes at 325°F. Substitute whole wheat flour if you prefer. Also try celery, cumin or caraway seeds.</span></span></p>

I was so taken with Celtic Promise that I wanted to share it with the guests at my wedding, until I drove one back to London from Wales and it became all too apparent that two dozen of them in a hot room might have made my big day memorable in a way I’d want to forget.</span></span></p>

It looks like one of those unctuous yellow Portuguese custard tarts and is every bit as rich. Each cheese has a hole in the top, into which you pour a little champagne or marc: quite a flavor sensation, and very handy if you’ve forgotten to pack glasses for your picnic. Langres isn’t the only cheese that has a meaty quality. Some detect a beefiness in Italy’s forceful taleggio. Émile Zola thought that Camembert smelled like venison. The French called Livarot from Normandy “the meat of the poor.” I find some fresh goat cheeses taste like a butcher’s shop smells. And then there’s the steak-fat blue cheese discussed in Blue Cheese &amp; Beef, <a href="#dummy_split_009.html#filepos260724">*</a>.

Peel back the rumpled, tarpaulin-like rind and you’ll discover an ivory-colored, fondue-like liquid, with a milky, salty, slightly fruity flavor, and a whiff of spruce from the box in the case of the (always unpasteurized) Haut-Doubs version from the French side of the border. Some people eat it straight from the box with a spoon, but I find a finger sufficient. It heats well too: take the lid off the box, wrap the box in foil, prick the surface of the cheese, insert some slivers of garlic, pour over 1/3 cup dry white wine, then bake it at 350°F for 20 minutes. Scoop from the box with good bread.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span class="calibre5">What makes blue cheese blue is a powdered blue-green mold called </span></span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">Penicillium roqueforti</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre5">. The dominant flavors in blue cheese are the fruity, spicy notes attributable to the ketone 2-heptanone, and a green, fatty, metallic note from 2-nonanone. Other than that, blue cheeses vary as widely in flavor as they do in provenance, depending on the animal’s diet, whether its milk has been pasteurized, the kind of starter and secondary cultures used, and the length of time and conditions under which it’s stored. Roquefort, famously, is aged in caves—its authenticity depends on it having been stored in the natural caves of Cambalou near Roquefort-sur-Soulzon in the Aveyron. Stilton is aged in cellars, where cool air can penetrate the tiny holes made in the cheese to help the mold spores do their work. A notable exception to the </span></span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">Penicillium roqueforti </span></span></span><span><span class="calibre5">rule is a rare blue cheese called Bleu de Termignon, made in tiny quantities in the French Alps with milk from pasture-grazed cattle, and allowed to blue naturally. Other blue cheeses covered in this chapter include Gorgonzola, Cabrales, Rogue River Blue, Shepherd’s Purse, Beenleigh Blue and Fourme d’Ambert.</span></span></p>

Devotees of the combination should seek out Shepherd’s Purse Buffalo Blue Cheese, made in North Yorkshire with locally reared buffalo’s milk, which is higher in saturated fat than cow’s milk. It has a luxurious flavor redolent of the fat on a really good, aged rump steak, with a similar melting texture. Kills two flavors with one stone—and it’s suitable for vegetarians.</span></span></p>

Cool in the fridge while you slice 2 celery  stalks into matchsticks. Tear Cos lettuce leaves as you would for a Caesar salad.

When the chicken is cooked, toss while still hot in a warmed mixture of 2 tbsp butter and 4 tbsp of hot sauce—Frank’s RedHot if you can get it, but anything nice and fiery will do.

Combine them in these Stilton and fig straws and serve with chilled tawny port. It’ll make a change to savor this pair of flavors at the start of an evening. In a food processor, make a dough of 1 cup plain flour, 1 2/3 cups crumbled Stilton, 4 tbsp butter, a pinch of salt and 1–2 tbsp cold milk. Roll out into a rectangle roughly 12 in x 8 in. Using scissors, snip about 8 dried mission figs into thin strips and lightly press into the dough. Along its width, fold one half of the dough over the other, with the fig on the inside. You will now have a rectangle roughly 6 in by 8 in. Roll it out to about ¼ in thick and cut into straws, using a palette knife to transfer them to a greased baking tray. Bake at 350°F for about 15 minutes. You might alternatively try blue cheese and fig in a salad with sturdy leaves and a port dressing. Boil ¾ cup port until reduced by about half, add 1 tsp honey and leave to cool. Whisk in 3 tbsp extra virgin olive oil, 2 tbsp balsamic vinegar and season.</span></span></p>

Take it as a hint. Milky, sweet, bitter-skinned walnut works wonders with all types of blue cheese. It’s a classic partnership, especially crumbled Roquefort and walnuts in a salad with chicory. Good dressed with extra virgin olive oil, cider vinegar and cream, 5:3:2, shaken up with seasoning. Try walnuts on a cheeseboard with Beenleigh Blue, made in Devon from ewe’s milk, which when mature has an almost fudgy texture and intensely peppery veins. Or with </span></span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">queso de Cabrales</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre5"> from Asturias in Spain, which has legendary strength: this cheese could fight bulls.</span></span></p>

<div class="calibre21">

<p><span><span class="calibre5">This covers a wide range of cheeses, including Cheddar, Parmigiano-Reggiano, Manchego, Comté, Gruyère, pecorino, Lincolnshire Poacher, Berkswell and Mahón. Flavors vary according to milk type, milk quality, the cheesemaker’s recipe, microflora and the cheese’s age. A good cheesemonger will be able to furnish you with a tasting flight of the same cheese at different stages of maturation, so that you can experience at first hand the effect aging has on flavor. Many hard cheeses are sweet, sour and salty, and gain crystals of umami as they age. It’s this array of tastes, in combination with its high fat content, that makes hard cheese both a satisfying eat in itself and a complement to other ingredients, enhancing their flavors with its rich roundness. Red wine, raw onion, watercress and walnuts often work well with hard cheese, as they add a balancing touch of bitterness. And sweet partners like dried fruit, cooked tomato and cooked onion can bring out the cheese’s savory side. When tasting hard cheese, look out for creamy, buttery, coconut, caramel, fruity (especially pineapple), sulfurous (chopped boiled egg), cooked, roasted and nutty flavors.</span></span></p>

Authentic Manchego is made with sheep’s milk in La Mancha, central Spain. It’s as widespread in its popularity as in the redolence of its flavors. Young Manchegos have a fresh, grassy quality evocative of the cool pastures of Galicia in the north. Older specimens exhibit the hot, dry saltiness of the Andalusian coast. Both would be good cut into thin slices and served with a bowl of toasted, salted almonds. If you’re lucky, they’ll be heart-shaped Spanish Marcona almonds, prized for their luscious, milky flavor.</span></span></p>

Rub with lemon juice, then cut in half lengthways, checking there’s no choke—if there is, remove it with a teaspoon. Slice each half into very fine strips, cutting from the top of the leaf to the stem. As you go, put the strips into water acidulated with lemon juice to prevent them browning.

Of course, the affinity of cheese with grape is clear in countless cheese-and-wine pairings. “Buy with crackers, sell with cheese,” they say in the wine trade: crackers cleanse the canny buyer’s palate, whereas cheese coats the taste buds with fats and proteins that can attenuate a wine’s harsher, tannic qualities.</span></span></p>

Everybody saw its goodness and beauty, but it was never invited to the ball. One evening, when the potato was all alone, a fairy godmother appeared and asked the poor, calloused, muddy vegetable its wish. And the potato said it would like nothing better than to be rid of its rough raiments and be made smooth and silky and acceptable to people who dined in the best restaurants of France. The fairy godmother waved her wand. The potato fell into a swoon and, in the winking of one of its many eyes, awoke in a restaurant called L’Ambassade d’Auvergne, right in the very heart of Paris, as part of the richest, silkiest mashed potato all the customers of the restaurant had ever seen. It was called </span></span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">aligot</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre5">, and, beside potato, was made with rich Laguiole</span></span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic"> </span></span></span><span><span class="calibre5">cheese, garlic, cream and butter, all stirred up together until the </span></span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">aligot</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre5"> was so elastic it could be whipped out of the pan to a height of three or even four feet without breaking. The following night the fairy godmother appeared again and asked the potato what its next wish was. The potato was feeling a bit queasy from the night before and fancied something cozy but sophisticated. The fairy waved her wand and the potato found itself lying sliced in warm, creamy layers with Gruyère cheese and his old friends, cream and garlic, in a potato dauphinoise. The potato loved to be free of its tatty jacket but wasn’t so sure about the roguish garlic and cream. The next evening, when the fairy godmother appeared and asked the potato what its third wish was, it has to be said that the potato came across as a little jaded. How about bathing in a sticky, fruity </span></span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">raclette</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre5">, the fairy godmother suggested—perhaps with a gaggle of cornichons? Or turning into smooth, pebble-like gnocchi smothered in fontina sauce? “Actually,” said the potato, “what I’d like most is to stay at home with a bottle of beer. And some Cheddar. As long as it’s Keen’s, mind you, or Westcombe’s, because if I’ve learned anything it’s that I’m too good for that greasy, one-dimensional pap I used to get saddled with.” “Get you,” said the fairy godmother, and vanished in a puff of smoke.</span></span></p>

Slice it thin and pair with prosciutto in a sandwich, or use for cheese on toast topped with a fried egg. And if good sage cheese isn’t available, you can always pair a strong hard cheese with sage in scones, and eat them warm with butter.</span></span></p>

Given a high-quality English cheese, by contrast, many people will advise against cooking with it, thinking it should be preserved for the cheeseboard. The makers of Lincolnshire Poacher (a Cheddar-like cheese with a bold, nutty flavor) beg to differ, on the parallel principle that you should apply the same standards to the wine you cook with as you do to the stuff you drink: “cooking” wine, like “cooking” cheese, will be as inferior in your dish as it is in the glass/on the board. I use a decent Côtes du Rhône for this hearty dish, which I call Lincolnshire Poacher’s Pot. Imagine that ratatouille went to a cheese and wine party, got drunk and lost eggplant and zucchini along the way. Soften a chopped large onion in oil over a medium heat for 5 minutes, then add a finely chopped garlic clove and a chunkily chopped green or red pepper (green brings a pleasing freshness). Cook slowly for another 5 minutes. Add a can of good-quality plum tomatoes and break them up with a spoon. Then add a scant tsp dried mixed herbs, 1/3 cup good red wine, 2 tbsp water, a pinch of sugar and some seasoning. Bring to the boil and simmer for 20–30 minutes. Taste and adjust the seasoning as necessary. Before serving, cut 6–8 oz Lincolnshire Poacher into half-inch cubes, add to the pan, still on the heat, then stir, giving them a minute or two to warm through. Decant into 2 earthenware bowls. Eat it before the cheese melts entirely. Crusty bread is essential.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span class="calibre5">Many of the soft cheeses covered in this chapter are eaten young, and retain fresh dairy flavors—the clean milkiness of mozzarella and cottage cheese, for example, or the slightly richer creaminess of Brillat-Savarin and Corsican brocciu. Bloomy cheeses like Brie and Camembert have a buttery taste when young but become more pungent, earthy and vegetal as they age, recalling the farmyard more than the dairy. While fresher, younger soft cheeses work well with salty and fruity (particularly berry) flavors, the more aged types are particularly harmonious with other earthy ingredients like mushrooms and truffles.</span></span></p>

A few high-quality, pink anchovy fillets can be served with a ball of mozzarella for a simple lunch. If you prepare this for a solitary meal, I think you should be allowed the entire ball. Not for gluttony’s sake, but simply for the pleasure of taking the whole thing in your hand and biting into it like a juicy apple. I love the initial resistance, followed by the absolute give. Chase with a sliver of anchovy.</span></span></p>

Or buy a whole cheese in a box, remove the wax paper, then put the cheese back in the box, prick the top and pour over some apple brandy. Bake for 20 minutes at 400°F. Serve with slices of apple. The sweet-toothed might prefer to drizzle a whole baked Brie with caramel, sprinkle it with walnuts and serve with wedges of sharp apple. I also like to serve apple with older Camembert. The cheese takes on something of a cooked-cabbage flavor as it ages, and this works very well with the fruit.</span></span></p>

Brocciu is served with fruit and jam for breakfast, with charcuterie for lunch and in cannelloni for dinner. You’ll see the sheep and goats it comes from hanging around on the hairpin bends of Corsica’s heart-stopping coastal-road system (they’ll quite possibly be the last things you see). We stopped in Calvi to buy a beach picnic for a walk along the coast path. We had stocked up on charcuterie, bread and tomatoes when the shop owner insisted that we also try some miniature red bell peppers stuffed with brocciu. A couple of hours later we were clambering over rocks in search of a lunch spot. As we unpacked the picnic, we were joined by first one wasp, then another, then nine more, until our </span></span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">al fresco</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre5"> paradise began to look like the set of a B-movie. As I lifted a stuffed pepper to my lips, a wasp heli-skied into the cheese, and in my flustered hand movement shooing it away I launched a piece of prosciutto onto a rock. One wasp chased after it, and then another, quickly followed by the others, and, ingenious by accident, we got on with our picnic in peace. Which begs the question: do wasps particularly like prosciutto or are they sick to the mandibles of brocciu? I’d come round to it myself, its sweet milkiness at once complemented and offset by the sweet smokiness of the peppers.</span></span></p>

Presented with a smear on a slice of baguette, my husband gave a deep, Gallic shrug. “Tastes like garlic bread.” And so it does. Which is no bad thing.</span></span></p>

When Russian and Eastern European immigrants arrived in America at the end of the nineteenth century, they found that salmon, a luxury back home, was in plentiful and affordable supply, and started to eat much more of it. Cream cheese, which began to be sold on a mass scale at around the same time, had a similar taste to the dairy products familiar from the old countries, and as it softened the extreme saltiness of the lox, the combination soon became a staple of Jewish-American cuisine. Some delis will gouge a trench in the bottom half of the bagel to accommodate a more satisfying depth of cheese.

Mix 1 tsp salt into 4 cups natural yogurt and transfer to the lined colander. Leave to drain at room temperature for about 8 hours.

Morel caps look like homemade beanies, knitted with big needles after one too many parsnip wines. In the nineteenth century a dish </span></span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">à la forestière</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre5"> signified a garnish of morels and diced bacon; today it is more likely to mean button mushrooms. Not that button mushrooms and bacon aren’t good in an omelette or crêpe, or even outstanding in a double-crust pie, when the mushroomy roux has turned to jellified umami. An old recipe worth reviving is the </span></span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">croûte baron</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre5">: a savory of grilled mushrooms and bacon on toast, covered with beef bone marrow and breadcrumbs, given another flash under the grill, then garnished with parsley.

Philip Howard, chef at The Square in London, serves pumpkin purée, chanterelles, leeks and black truffle with scallops (he also makes a dish of langoustine with pumpkin purée, rings of trompette mushrooms, a field mushroom purée, Parmesan gnocchi and a potato and truffle emulsion).

Japanese shiitake mushrooms take their name from </span></span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">shii</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre5">, a species of chestnut tree, and </span></span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">take</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre5">, meaning mushroom. The chestnut association is strong in mushrooms because of their symbiosis in the wild: mushrooms grow under chestnut trees. In northern Italy a tagliatelle is made with chestnut flour to serve with earthy-sweet dried porcini. Mushrooms and chestnuts are cooked together bourguignon-style, with shallots, bacon and red wine, and served in a pastry or suet crust. And the food writer Richard Mabey combines porcini and chestnuts in a soup. It can be made with fresh, but he pronounces vacuum-packed pre-cooked chestnuts excellent. Simmer 8 oz vacuum-packed chestnuts in just enough water to cover for 40 minutes. Meanwhile, rehydrate 1 oz dried porcini mushrooms in just enough hot water to cover them for 30 minutes. Cook 1 diced onion and 4 chopped bacon slices in a bit more butter than you ought and add to the cooked chestnuts with the mushrooms and their soaking water. Simmer for 15 minutes, then purée in batches. Reheat and season to taste, adding a squeeze of lemon and a schooner of fino sherry before serving. Apply some rouge to your cheeks and a little dab of cocoa under the fingernails, and you can claim to have foraged for the ingredients beyond the back of the cupboard.</span></span></p>

Shiitake contain a compound called lenthionine, chemically similar to the sulfides found in alliums such as garlic and onion, and, like them, they are prized for their flavor-enhancing properties. Lenthionine content is maximized by drying and rehydration. You won’t get the same results with fresh shiitake, but you can tuck slivers of garlic into their gills and give them a drizzle of olive oil and a sprinkle of salt before grilling or frying them.</span></span></p>

Six or seven days later, when they open fully to display their inky gills, they become portabellas. Until the 1980s they were considered unsalable, and mushroom farm workers took them home as perks. Then it dawned on someone that their pronounced flavor might, after all, be marketable, especially if they had a fancy Italian name. So they made one up. The portabella owes its success partly to its size and shape: it’s at once an instant veggie burger and a mushroom that life isn’t too short to stuff. Its rusticity is particularly well paired with goat cheese, which adds a welcome tanginess. Place 6 portabellas, cap down, on an oiled baking tray. The black gills look like lined-up 45s seen through the window of a jukebox. Scrape them out, but leave the stalks. Mash </span></span><span><span class="calibre22">½</span></span><span><span class="calibre5"> lb goat cheese with 1 tbsp olive oil, a handful of chopped parsley and plenty of salt and pepper.

Parmesan provides some saltiness in a mushroom risotto, pasta or bruschetta, while Gruyère is delicious with mushrooms on toast. And grated pecorino romano with finely chopped mushrooms is the beginning of a pesto-like sauce. Put some cooked mushrooms in a food processor with grated pecorino, toasted walnuts, garlic, parsley (or basil, or both) and olive oil—all particularly good partners for mushroom—and pulse until you’ve achieved your desired texture. Balance the flavors to taste. Great on pasta, clearly, but also spread on a baguette for a steak or sausage sandwich</span></span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">.</span></span></span></p>

Not all versions include pork, but this one does. Take 1½ lb small, slim eggplants and cut them lengthways into quarters. Heat 2 cups oil in a wok and deep-fry the eggplant pieces a few at a time until golden and tender, then drain on kitchen paper. Discard all but a few tablespoons of the oil, get the wok nice and hot again, then add 1–2 tbsp Sichuan chili bean paste, muddling it into the oil. Add 2 tbsp each finely chopped fresh ginger and garlic, 1 lb minced pork and 3 tbsp sliced scallions. Stir-fry for 30 seconds, then add 3 tbsp rice wine (or sherry), 3 tbsp black rice vinegar (or cheap balsamic), 2 tbsp sugar, 1 tbsp roasted and crushed Sichuan peppercorns, and 2 tsp ground red chili. Cook over a high heat for 2 minutes, add ½ cup chicken stock and simmer for a further 3 minutes. Finally add the eggplants and simmer for 3 minutes. If you can’t bear to deep-fry your eggplants, shallow-fry them instead. You don’t get the same texture, but the sauce is so good I’m tempted to say it hardly matters.</span></span></p>

If you can’t find them, there’s no reason not to give an ordinary eggplant the Japanese treatment. They love to soak up the flavor of miso, or this ginger and soy broth. Cut a couple of eggplants into bite-sized pieces, sprinkle with salt and leave for 20–30 minutes. Rinse, squeeze gently and pat dry. Fry in peanut oil until just golden, then add 1 tbsp grated fresh ginger, 2 tbsp soy sauce, 1 tbsp sugar and just enough water to cover. Simmer for 20–30 minutes with a foil or greaseproof paper lid on top of the mixture (not on top of the pan). Garnish with the green part of scallions, thinly sliced, and/or a scattering of sesame seeds. Serve with boiled rice.</span></span></p>

Either way, don’t be tempted to use ready-ground nutmeg—it has to be freshly grated to order.</span></span></p>

Their reciprocity is clearer in this Armenian apricot soup recipe from David Ansel. Apricots originated in Armenia, where fruit (especially cherry) soups are popular. Dice an onion and a couple of carrots, sauté in olive oil for 10 minutes, then add 2 tsp ground cumin. Lower the heat, cover and sweat for 10 minutes. Add 1</span></span><span><span class="calibre22">½</span></span><span><span class="calibre5"> cups red lentils and as much of 5 cups water as you need to cover them. Bring to a simmer and cook for 20 minutes, adding more of the water if necessary as the lentils expand.

Cumin is also excellent in an apricot conserve to eat with Camembert.</span></span></p>

Just as well, as this has surely been the signature partnership of the last ten years, in the same way roasted peppers were inseparable from tomatoes in the 1990s. Goat cheese soufflé with beet ice cream. Horseradish and beet tart with a goat cheese meringue. Goat cheese panna cotta with beet caviar. Primp them as you will, to me they’re at their best muddled with warm green beans and a few crushed walnuts. And this risotto is good too, if rather pink. Soften a finely chopped small onion in olive oil, then add ¾ cup risotto rice, stirring until the grains are coated in oil. Add a sherry glass of white wine and cook until evaporated. Mix in 4 medium diced or grated cooked beets, then add 3 cups hot vegetable stock, one ladle at a time, stirring constantly, until the rice is cooked to your liking. Add a few tablespoons of finely grated Parmesan and some seasoning. Divide between 2 plates and serve, topped with a scattering of goat cheese cut into small cubes. Garnish with lemon thyme leaves, if you have them.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span class="calibre5">Potatoes are sweet and slightly bitter (if the bitterness is pronounced, and the skin green, they’re fit only for the compost bin). Good potatoes are characterized by combinations of buttery, creamy, nutty and earthy flavors. When baked, the skin of old potatoes can have a malty, dusty cocoa character. Cooks tend initially to divide potatoes by texture rather than flavor, as the waxiness, flouriness or firm bite dictates the ideal cooking method. Waxy potatoes usually have a more concentrated flavor, while floury are often described as bland or light tasting. A trained testing panel coordinated by the Scottish Crop Research Institute recently found a direct correlation between levels of umami-forming compounds in potato varieties and their intensity of flavor. The best-performing cultivars were derived from the “phureja” strain—look out for Mayan Gold, whose flesh is butter-yellow, rich in flavor and makes fries so tasty you’ll be tempted to skip the ketchup. The potato’s sweetness is particularly heavenly when contrasted with salty foods such as fish, hard cheese, caviar and salted butter.</span></span></p>

At too low a temperature, the starch turns to sugar, so that when the potatoes are cooked they begin to caramelize, resulting in a dark-brown French fry with an unpleasantly bittersweet flavor. Which won’t do. The partnership of potato and beef is too important, whether in </span></span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">steak frites</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre5"> or burger and fries, the fanciest rib of beef with roast potatoes or the everyday cottage pie.</span></span></p>

Beet’s potting-shed flavor is attributable to a compound called geosmin, which can also be detected in the smell of just-caught, bottom-feeding freshwater fish such as carp, and in “petrichor,” a term coined by two Australian researchers for the distinctive aroma released by rain on earth or concrete following a dry spell. Potato’s earthy flavor comes from a different compound. If you like earthy aromas and flavors, they’re also to be found in mushrooms, truffles, cooked onion and garlic, some cheeses, and aged Bordeaux and Burgundy.

This is a rustic blend of potatoes and onions with cabbage, often made even less decorative by the addition of a ragged hunk of chorizo. Originally from the Minho region in the north, </span></span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">caldo verde </span></span></span><span><span class="calibre5">is now something of a national dish and is equally popular in Brazil. Try it and you’ll see why: high-quality potatoes are used, and the Galician cabbage, with its wide, kale-like leaves, gives the soup a dark, serious depth. Try making it anywhere else and you’d be advised to use floury, rather than waxy potatoes—they need to fall apart and thicken the broth. Galician cabbage can be hard to come by outside Portugal, and collard greens, spring greens or </span></span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">kai-lan</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre5"> (Chinese broccoli)</span></span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic"> </span></span></span><span><span class="calibre5">can be used instead. Peel 2 lb floury potatoes, cut into chunks and bring to the boil in 6 cups salted water. Simmer until tender, then roughly mash them into the water and bring back to the boil. Add ½ lb finely chopped greens and cook for about 10 minutes. If you like the idea of the sausage, put it in with the potatoes, remove it at the mashing stage and cut it into chunks, then return it to the soup with the greens.

They’re popularly paired in a canapé of warm roasted baby potatoes topped with cold sour cream and caviar, the temperature differential creating an additional pleasing contrast.

The trick is to use a mixture of different fungi to layer the flavors, as you might use a variety of fish in a bouillabaisse. I like the Italian chef Gennaro Contaldo’s recipe, not just for its mixture of fresh and dried mushrooms but for the addition of potato, which thickens the soup while contributing its own earthy flavor. Soften a chopped onion in 4 tbsp olive oil, then add 1 lb chopped wild mushrooms and sauté for 5 minutes. Add 1 quart vegetable stock, 1 oz reconstituted dried porcini (with their soaking water) and a peeled and finely chopped potato. Bring to the boil, turn down the heat and simmer for 20 minutes. Cool slightly and blend until smooth. Reheat, season to taste and serve with crusty bread and the door firmly bolted.</span></span></p>

When I was a kid, there was always a sack of potatoes and a sack of onions in the garage: they had the same status as logs. Living in a poky flat in the middle of the city, as I do now, the car is parked in the street and has become a garage itself—internalizing what would have housed it. Because it’s dark and usually larder-cool, I keep my potatoes and onions in the trunk. And yet within half an hour, these utilitarian vegetables, nestled amid the outdoor gear and plastic bottles of brake fluid, might be baked in milk, or sautéed together, or combined to make a creamy onion mash, or grated and fried in a rösti, or chopped in a simultaneously comforting and zestful potato salad, or layered with cheese for a golden-brown pan haggerty or, most transcendently of all, combined with a few eggs in a tortilla, so much more than the sum of its parts.</span></span></p>

The exact origins of </span></span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">frites</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre5"> are obscure but the term “French-fried potatoes” began to appear in the mid-nineteenth century, shortly before the introduction of Heinz tomato ketchup in 1876. The singular thing about ketchup is its strength in all five basic taste categories: it is sweet, sour, bitter, salty and rich in umami. Tomato naturally contains umami, as does potato; that’s deliciousness squared. Elizabeth David gives a Greek recipe for mashed potato mixed with skinned, finely chopped tomato, sliced scallion, parsley, melted butter and flour, shaped into patties, then fried or baked. She also mentions a French recipe for a cream of tomato and potato soup: in brief, you soften the chopped whites of 2 leeks in butter, then add ½ lb roughly chopped tomatoes and cook them until they ooze their juice. Next add ¾ lb diced peeled potatoes, some salt, a little sugar and 3 cups water. Bring to the boil and simmer for 25 minutes. Liquefy and sieve, then return to a clean pan  and add 2/3 cup cream. Warm through and serve with parsley or chervil.

<p><span><span class="calibre5">This section covers celery stalks, celeriac (the swollen base of a celery relative) and celery seeds, which are harvested from smallage, or wild celery, and crushed to make celery salt. All share with the herb lovage a pair of compounds that give them their characteristic celery flavor. This is most potent in celery seeds, which are warm and bitter with a complex herbal, citrus quality; some are more lemony than others. Celery seeds can be useful when you don’t have any stalks, or when they prove unwieldy. The stalks have a rather more salty, anise character, whereas celeriac is mild and adds root-vegetable sweetness and earthiness to the celery flavor. The seeds, stems and leaves of lovage are all used, and an alcoholic cordial is made of it to drink with brandy. Celery flavor is particularly savory, recalling stocks and broths; accordingly it’s used in soups and stews, where it emphasizes the sweetness of meat and seafood.</span></span></p>

Throughout the nineteenth century, British and American cookbook writers stipulated celery sauce as the natural accompaniment to boiled fowl—indeed, celery sauce was traditionally served with an oyster-stuffed turkey at the English Christmas dinner. Hannah Glasse gives several recipes for it. One involves cutting celery stalks into pieces and simmering them in a little water. When the celery is soft, add mace, nutmeg and seasoning, then thicken the cooking liquid with butter and flour. Other versions are made with veal stock, cream or both. In recent years, scientific studies have shown that celery contains volatile compounds that, although not individually distinguishable to the human palate, significantly enhance sweet and umami notes in chicken stock.</span></span></p>

You might take the elements and recast them in a more grown-up, Thai-influenced salad.

<p><span><span class="calibre5">With its bittersweet, peppery, mineral freshness, watercress used to be a popular garnish for roast meats. All very well but it deserves a starrier role than culinary spear carrier. It is great paired with a salty and a sweet ingredient—blitzed into a salty stock with sweet milk or cream for a sublime soup, or pressed between slices of sweet bread and salty butter in a sandwich. Liquefied with sour cream and a pinch of salt, watercress makes a sauce that is as refreshing as dandling your feet in the river on a hot afternoon.</span></span></p>

Why not anglicize the dish by substituting watercress for the arugula? A change from the more familiar practice of cramming the leaves in a thick sandwich with roast beef.

You might also detect a faint metallic tang in them both, as if you’d let the tines of your fork linger in your mouth a moment too long. By all means combine them in a salad with pear and walnut, or in a soup, soufflé or tart. But there’s nothing quite like spreading bread with buttery Stilton, deep enough to leave a pleasing impression of your teeth when you bite into it, and scattering it with watercress leaves.

The sweetness of the meat is emphasized by the hot, peppery kick of watercress, but the leaf’s refreshing greenness simultaneously lightens the combination. In France, watercress is the classic garnish for roast chicken, and works particularly well when the sweetness of the flesh and the bitterness of the leaves are balanced by crisp, salty skin—although a few olives, or a Thai dressing made with fish sauce and lime juice, do the same trick if you like to eat only the lean white meat. A warm watercress sauce for chicken can be made very quickly. Soften a couple of shallots in butter, then add about 1/3 cup white wine and simmer until reduced to about 1 tbsp. Add 1 2/3 cups hot chicken or vegetable stock, simmer for 5 minutes and add 2/3 cup cream. When heated through, add 8 oz chopped watercress, cook for 1–2 minutes, check the seasoning and blend.</span></span></p>

There’s no finer contrast for a sandwich to eat with your little finger in the air. The Ritz Hotel in London serves egg mayonnaise and cress bridge rolls (like miniature hot dog buns) as part of its afternoon tea.

Or pair them raw in a salad, dressed with walnut oil and sherry vinegar, as long as you’re prepared, as a goat would be, to give the leaves a long, ruminative chew.</span></span></p>

As with other natural pairings, trout and watercress are sufficiently harmonious to need a minimum of preparation. To serve two, fry a trout each in clarified butter for about 5 minutes on each side, and make a watercress sauce by blending a bunch with 2/3 cup sour cream, a squeeze of lemon and a pinch of salt and sugar.

If you use a lot of watercress, you might consider growing land cress, which has a similar flavor and grows easily through the winter under a cloche. Some say land cress is stronger flavored, and that you should use less of it in a soup than you would watercress. I say use more stock and potato and make more soup.</span></span></p>

Submerge a leg of mutton, or </span></span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">gigot</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre5">, in an oval-shaped pot full of water and bring very slowly to the boil. Skim the fat from the surface and add 6 leeks, 2 rutabagas, 6 carrots and 4 turnips, all chopped into hearty chunks. Simmer for about 2 hours. Just before the cooking time is up, melt 1 oz butter in a saucepan, add 1 oz plain flour and stir into a creamy paste. Pour in 1/3 cup warm milk and whisk until smooth. Then add 2/3 cup stock from the mutton pan and simmer gently for about 20 minutes, until you have a velvety, luxurious sauce. Stir in 3–4 tbsp rinsed, drained capers, check the seasoning and pour into a jug. Remove the mutton from the stock, place on a serving plate surrounded by the vegetables and pour over the sauce.

Spread a base with tomato sauce (see Garlic &amp; Basil, <a href="#dummy_split_012.html#filepos489706">*</a>, for a good one), then scatter over thin slices of red onion, canned tuna, anchovies, olives and capers.

It’s worth remembering to add the buds to the cold oil and bring them up to heat. Tossed into hot fat, they’re in danger of becoming tiny, briny incendiary devices. Note that long cooking intensifies the flavor of capers. In Greece, the leaves of the caper bush are eaten with potatoes and with fish. They have a more mustardy-thyme flavor than the buds.

Taking care not to let it burn, heat 6 tbsp butter in a pan until deeply golden. Add 1 tsp white wine vinegar and 1–2 tbsp drained rinsed capers.

<p><span><span class="calibre5">Horseradish is a bruiser with a gentle side. Cut or grate it and its natural defense mechanism releases hot, bitter compounds to make your eyes run and your nose burn. For that reason, it’s usually paired with the sort of pugnacious flavors that can stand up to it—smoked foods, roast beef, piquant cheeses and spicy, boozy tomato juice. Treated gently, however, in small doses, it can tease out the delicate flavors of raw seafood. In common with other hot ingredients such as chili and mustard, horseradish is a showcaser, drawing attention to what’s in your mouth. It has a slight freshening quality, too, knocking a little fishiness off uncooked seafood, or the earthiness from potato and beet. This chapter also covers wasabi.</span></span></p>

Salty, sweet, sour: how could they not? Which is why so many swear by tomato sauce on their bacon sandwiches. I understand the force of habit in these cases, but everyone should try horseradish sauce at least once, especially when smoked bacon is at stake. If it’s good smoked bacon, I’d go so far as to say that horseradish is just plain better, complementing the bacon’s charry brininess where ketchup puts up a fight. Mix 1 tbsp prepared horseradish with 4 tbsp mayo. Spread more than you should on toasted brown bread, lay the bacon on top, then some sickle-shapes of sliced avocado and a few leaves of crisp Cos lettuce. Sink your teeth in and feel your eyeballs begin to turn upwards. Note how the horseradish gets behind the bacon and gives it a nip on the backside.</span></span></p>

Wasabi and horseradish are close relatives. Both have a pungent, metallic flavor that comes from volatile sulfur compounds liberated as a defensive measure when the plant is damaged—i.e., grated. Horseradish has the more radishy, watercress-like flavor. Most wasabi served in Western restaurants isn’t wasabi at all but horseradish dyed green; the same goes for many store-bought varieties. Mind you, any more than a lentil’s worth and you’ll be weeping hot tears through your nose, so in the quantities it’s appropriate to use you’d be hard pushed to notice the difference in flavor. If you do overdo it, the secret, according to Harold McGee, is to breathe out through the mouth, so the wasabi fumes don’t irritate your nasal passages, and in through the nose, to bypass the residue in your mouth. Or you could just weep and wait like the rest of us.</span></span></p>

We wanted to try the local dish of bigoli pasta with anchovies and onions. A platter so enormous a gondolier might have punted it onto our table arrived, along with several pitchers of Soave. Bigoli is like whole-wheat spaghetti but thicker, with a nutty, rugged character. It makes an ideal carrier for the sweet and salty mixture of anchovies and onions. You can make this with whole-wheat spaghetti if you can’t get the real thing. For two people, soften 3 thinly sliced large onions in 2–3 tbsp olive oil over a medium heat for about 20 minutes, without letting them color. Once they’ve had about 10 minutes, add 4 or 5 chopped anchovies. Mix them in, break them up a bit and season, bearing in mind how salty the anchovy is to begin with. Cook the pasta until it is </span></span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">al dente</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre5">. Drain it, reserving about a tablespoon of water, and return both to the pan. Place back on the heat and stir in the sauce. For an extra touch of sweetness, add a tablespoon of currants to the onion mix. You could try some of anchovy’s other matches in this too: a little rosemary, perhaps, some blanched chopped broccoli or a sprinkling of capers.</span></span></p>

But it’s the tang of the onion, softened by the aromatic, fireside warmth of the clove, that gives the sauce its special, irresistible depth. It’s the Ugg boot of sauces. You might also try the combination in a clove-infused chicken and onion sandwich. For two baguette sandwiches of about 6 in each, thinly slice a Spanish onion, then cook it nice and slowly in 1 tbsp peanut oil, a dab of butter and ½ tsp ground cloves. Warm the bread, slice some hot, cooked chicken. When the onion is meltingly soft, you could add a few tablespoons of cream, then warm the mixture through. Spread it onto the bread before laying on the chicken slices. Great with a glass of Pinot Noir.</span></span></p>

Look out for sweet onion varieties such as Vidalia, Empire and Supasweet. The higher sugar levels in sweeter onions come at the expense of pyruvic acid, the defensive chemical responsible for stronger onions’ pungency, aftertaste and the teardrops on your cutting board. If you can’t get naturally sweet onions, you could try giving your cut onions a rinse in cold water, which arrests some of the stronger sulfur compounds released when you damage their flesh. Blood orange and red onion make a pretty pair on the plate, and red onion is often (though not always) on the sweeter, milder side.</span></span></p>

</div>
<p><span><span class="calibre5">Adding a small amount of garlic to meat, seafood, green vegetables and even truffles is like drawing a keyline around their flavor—everything gains a sharper definition. Garlic also adds something of a succulent quality. For a mild garlic flavor, infuse warm cooking oil with a whole, unchopped clove; for something more potent, use it raw and crushed to a paste. There are two types of garlic—softneck and hardneck. Softneck is the type you’re most likely to find in the supermarket or plaited into a braid, as it’s easier to grow, but hardnecks tend to have the better flavor. Try a side-by-side garlic tasting by making garlic bread or aioli with a range of different bulbs, looking out for their different hot, sweet, earthy, metallic, fruity, nutty, rubbery and floral (lily) characters. Elephant garlic is milder and considered part of the leek rather than the true garlic family. Garlic can be bought in powdered, flaked, paste and salt forms, or ready chopped in jars, although I find these prepared products often have a piercing quality and miss the earthy, volatile perfume of fresh cloves. Garlic’s main use is in heightening the flavor of savory dishes, but it makes a fantastic primary flavor on a sweet, bland background like bread or pasta, or, in the case of a roasted garlic risotto, rice.</span></span></p>

Garlic contains a sulfoxide called allicin, which is converted into allicin when the garlic is sliced or crushed. Allicin, in turn, is converted into the sulfide compounds responsible for crushed garlic’s characteristic aroma. The more brutally you rupture your garlic, the more alliin is converted.</span></span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic"> </span></span></span><span><span class="calibre5">The almond in </span></span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">ajo blanco</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre5"> takes the edge off the pungency, as does serving it cold, so you shouldn’t be tempted to underplay the garlic. Soak a handful of crustless stale white bread in water or milk. In a food processor place 2 cups ground blanched almonds, the bread (squeezed dry) and 2 peeled, crushed garlic cloves. Pulse until you have a paste. With the motor running, add 3 tbsp olive oil slowly through the feed tube followed by 3 cups iced water. Season and stir in sherry vinegar (1–3 tbsp) to taste.

Essentially they pull the flavors of the tomato in opposite directions, stretching it out to its fullest potential. At one end of the spectrum, garlic picks up on the strong dimethyl sulfide flavor of canned tomato, taking it further in a savory vegetal direction; at the other, basil replaces the green, slightly grassy flavors that tomatoes lose in the canning process, lightening and freshening the sauce. Roughly chop 4 or 5 garlic cloves and soften them in olive oil. When they’ve taken on a little color, add 4 cans of whole plum tomatoes and a generous handful of roughly torn basil leaves. Break up the tomatoes, season and bring to the boil. Remove from the heat and pass through a sieve, working the mixture with a wooden spoon. Discard the garlicky, basilly tomato pulp and pour the sauce back in the pan. Bring to a simmer and let it reduce until it starts plopping like a hot swamp—it should be roughly the consistency of ketchup. Use for pasta or pizza. Gets really heavenly if you keep any excess in the fridge overnight with a couple of fresh basil leaves in it.</span></span></p>

Safer to stick to the old Provençal recipe for chicken with 40 cloves of garlic. As the name suggests, you simply roast your chicken with 40 garlic cloves, unpeeled and with their pointy noses lopped off in order that the hot, sweet garlic paste can be squeezed from the skin directly onto toasted rounds of French bread. The garlic goes through a complete personality change, losing its aggressive pungency and turning caramel-sweet, with a chestnutty flavor. But for all its apparent mellowness, roasted garlic lingers no less obstinately on the breath. Last time I made the recipe, I took a cab the following morning and the driver kept giving me dirty looks in the rearview mirror. </span></span></p>

The original was made with pungent raw garlic, but he tamps things down by using fried in his version. In tsatsiki, perhaps garlic and cucumber’s most famous collaboration, yogurt moderates matters even further, but the hot ardency of garlic still persists. Seed, then coarsely grate or dice half a cucumber, squeeze as much water out of it as you can, and mix with 1 full cup yogurt, a garlic clove crushed with salt, and a tablespoon or two of chopped mint (you might try using yogurt made with sheep’s or goat’s milk, the flavors of which go particularly well with cucumber). Serve with fatty lamb chops and crusty bread. Or thin with light stock to make a refreshing cold soup, remembering that cucumber will yield more of its water as the flavors meld in the fridge.</span></span></p>

Process equal quantities by weight of peeled garlic and ginger into a paste, adding about 1 tbsp water per 3 oz.

A similar injunction against onion and garlic exists in Hindu Brahmin culture. The Jains, for their part, avoid onion and garlic as well as root vegetables, for fear that they might contain living things. As a substitute, both Brahmins and Jains might use the resinous gum called asafetida, which has a pungent, alliaceous flavor. That it’s also known as both “devil’s dung” and “food of the gods” might recall the equivocal gorgeous/gruesome qualities ascribed to truffles. Raw asafetida resin smells sickeningly sulfurous (the powdered form much less so), but cooked it imbues food with an earthy, savory tang. Although most commonly associated with Indian cuisine, it’s native to Iran, where it’s sometimes rubbed onto serving plates for meat. Asafetida was so treasured in Roman times that it forms part of half the recipes in Apicius. If you’re quite into having your senses excited, you might try five-onion soup, made with garlic, onion, scallions, leek and chives.</span></span></p>

The following (foolproof) method follows his advice and will mean that you’ll never again have to consign an insipid attempt to the trash. Chop an eggplant, a red onion, a red bell pepper and 3 small zucchini into small chunks (not dice; think about half a wine cork) and put in a solid ovenproof dish with a can of peeled plum tomatoes. Break up the tomatoes with a spoon and mix in 8 thinly sliced garlic cloves, 8 sprigs of thyme, a few generous glugs of olive oil and some seasoning. Roast at 375°F for an hour, stirring once or twice. Some add a tablespoon of red wine vinegar to perk it up before serving. Really good with Gruyère in buckwheat pancakes.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span class="calibre5">The price of fresh truffles usually means that they’re used sparingly and allowed to dominate without other ingredients getting in the way of their musky, pungent complexity. “Truffle flavor” has, of course, become increasingly ubiquitous. The flavor of white truffles has been successfully synthesized in the form of a compound called bis(methylthio)methane, which is used to make the truffle oil drizzled, not always advisedly, over thousands of restaurant dishes, and sometimes injected into inferior, flavorless truffles for shaving tableside. Fungal fraud aside, there’s nothing wrong with synthetic truffle oil, which can work wonders pepping up mashed potato, cauliflower, cabbage or macaroni and cheese, and will certainly give you an idea of what truffle tastes like if you’ve never had the real thing. In the same way that reading the study guide for </span></span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">Anna Karenina</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre5">, rather than the actual novel, will give you an idea of the book.</span></span></p>

When the truffle has had a day or two to infuse the fatty egg yolk, make a simple omelette, scrambled egg or fried egg dish. You won’t be sorry. Fat is essential for releasing and carrying the flavor of truffle; butter and goose fat give particularly good results. Some cooks use garlic to intensify the flavor of truffle served with eggs, by rubbing a cut clove either on a slice of toast or on the inside of the receptacle that the eggs are beaten in before scrambling.</span></span></p>

Both white and black truffles combine easily with garlic and could probably turn Styrofoam into a rich, sticky feast.</span></span></p>

As father says, the truffles are “very different from the tough leathery things I remember from Europe,” reasoning that he’d only ever tasted truffles robbed of their freshness during long transportation. Truffles start to oxidize as soon as they’re unearthed, at first becoming quite pungent, then fading to a bland bitterness. At a charity auction in 2004, a consortium forked out £28,000 (roughly $42,000) for the second-largest white truffle ever found, which was then locked up in a refrigerated safe at the London restaurant Zafferano. Then the restaurant manager went away for four days with the key in his pocket. By the time he returned, the truffle was ruined. There’s simply no effective way to keep truffles fresh—a problem the Swiss Family might have solved by making truffled wild boar salami, mortadella or pancetta—or their home country’s truffled </span></span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">cervelas</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre5"> sausage.</span></span></p>

A key flavor compound of white truffle, bis(methylthio)-methane, which has a sulfurous, garlicky, spicy, mushroom quality, also naturally occurs in lobster (and in shiitake mushrooms and some pungent cheeses such as Camembert). Other crustaceans and scallops are also often paired with truffle, and cabbage forms a common trio.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span class="calibre5">This section includes various types of cabbage, including preserved cabbage and Brussels sprouts, and a wide range of flavors, from the fresh spiciness of raw cabbage to the corridor-filling sulfurousness of well-cooked common cabbage.

Cooked cabbage pairs brilliantly with other pungent ingredients such as garlic, onion, truffle and mustard. Salty bacon or anchovy knocks back some of the bitter flavors—think how bacon tames sprouts. Savoy and Chinese (or Napa) cabbages are revered for their fine flavors, and their crinkly leaves are ideal for absorbing sauces in stir-fries. Intriguingly, cabbages have a clear affinity for apple, and sprouts are delectable with both dried cranberries and red currant jelly.</span></span></p>

Mrs. Beeton noted that a good stomach was needed to digest it. This warm autumn dish, inspired by panzanella, is so rustic it should come in a John Deere salad bowl. Tear half a slightly stale ciabatta loaf into chunks and grill them. Roast 1 lb halved small Brussels sprouts in olive oil at 350ºF for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, slowly fry a chopped garlic clove, 5 scallions cut into ½ in pieces and 6 oz bacon lardoons in 2 tbsp olive oil until the lardoons have browned and a good deal of their fat has rendered into the pan. Remove with a slotted spoon and add to the sprouts with the toasted bread. Toss the mixture, put it back in the oven and turn off the heat. Deglaze the bacon and onion pan with 2 tbsp red wine vinegar, add 1–2 tbsp water or chicken stock and cook for 1 minute. Remove the sprout mixture from the oven and drizzle it with the contents of the pan. Season, add 2 tbsp dried cranberries and toss. Serve while still warm.</span></span></p>

If you find their bitterness unpleasant, you might try growing Thompson &amp; Morgan’s Trafalgar F1 sprouts from seed.

I love it so much that I often cook more potatoes than we can possibly eat with the roast chicken on Sunday. Whether premeditated surplus actually counts as leftovers is, however, a taxing philosophical problem. Processed-food companies now sell ready-made bubble and squeak, i.e., leftovers with no main meal from which they’ve been left over, which raises a number of dizzying questions. Can, for example, leftovers left over from nothing actually be said to exist? And what do you call it if you have any left over?</span></span></p>

Parboil a whole Savoy cabbage for 10 minutes, allow it to cool, then fold back the leaves, taking care not to snap them off. When you’re left with a cabbage center about the size of a small tangerine, slice it out and replace with an equal volume of stuffing. Replace the leaves layer by layer, cramming a measure of stuffing between each, until your cabbage is fully reassembled. Tie with string to secure. Finally, melt a few tablespoons of butter in a lidded pot big enough to take the cabbage, add a chopped small onion and carrot and cook until soft. Throw in a bouquet garni and some seasoning, add 1 cup chicken or vegetable stock and lower in your cabbage. Cover and simmer for 1½ hours. When it’s done, take the cabbage out and keep it warm while you strain the cooking liquid into a jug to serve as a sauce.

It’s also present in seafood: the primary flavor of scallops comes from a precursor that releases DMS (a precursor is a compound involved in a chemical reaction that releases another compound). DMS has been used, not always successfully, to re-create more authentic seafood flavors. More importantly from the home cook’s perspective, it proves the deep affinity cabbage has with shellfish—if you needed proof having taken a single bite of a minced shrimp and Chinese cabbage dumpling.

We would invariably eat the carrots and leave the rutabaga on the side of the plate. Scientists now believe that the aversion to bitter vegetables, indeed all bitter flavors, is genetically determined, and boils down to sensitivity to the compound 6-n-propylthiouracil, known in flavor-scientist circles as “prop.” If you can strongly detect the taste of prop in broccoli, for instance, you may well be one of the 25 percent of the population known as “super-tasters,” which is more of a hindrance than it sounds. Super-tasters, who are more likely to be female, find brassicas, grapefruit and black coffee unbearably intense. Another quarter of the population can’t detect prop at all. I might have put my childhood dislike of rutabaga down to being a super-taster if it hadn’t vanished overnight in my late teens, like acne or the desire to wear purple eye shadow. Carrot sweetens rutabaga, and they’re excellent mashed together with lots of butter and white pepper.</span></span></p>

Where its dark-green cruciferous cousin is frisky, iron-deep and complex, cauliflower is keener on the quiet life, snug under its blanket of cheese. It needs to be livened up a bit, which is where capers come in. You don’t so much add capers to cauliflower—you set them on it. Cook a chopped onion in olive oil until soft, add some chili flakes and chopped garlic and stir for a few seconds. Add some blanched cauliflower florets, breadcrumbs and raisins and cook until the breadcrumbs are browned. Finally add capers and parsley, warm them through, then serve the mixture tossed with rigatoni.</span></span></p>

If I was being pedantic, in color terms it might have more accurately been called the Double Gloucester, but I kept this to myself and simply asked the stallholder what it tasted like. “Cauliflower,” he said, as if I was dumb to ask, but I bought one anyway, as by that point cauliflower cheese was a foregone conclusion for that evening’s supper. I might equally, in fact, have made it with Double Gloucester, as its rich butteriness and hints of citrus and onion make a delicious cheese sauce. But there was none to be had, so I used a heady Gruyère, whose combination of potency and nuttiness is a match for the cauliflower’s.</span></span></p>

The white cabbage flavor of raw cauliflower combined with the dried fruit might put you in mind of a coleslaw with raisins, but the chunkier texture, the extreme sweetness of the dates, and the sour cream make it discernibly different. Cut a cauliflower into small florets about 1 in long, ½ in across. For each 4 oz cauliflower florets, chop up 1 Medjool date and break 5 or 6 walnut halves in half again. Mix in a bowl and (for around 8–12 oz cauliflower) dress with a combination of 2/3 cup sour cream, 2 tsp lemon juice, 2 tsp superfine sugar, ¼ tsp salt and a grind of black pepper.

In my experience people tend to love or hate broccoli, and the point of a vegetable that’s just like it, except less so, is lost on me. The other variety of green cauliflower is perhaps better known as Romanesco, in equal parts famous and frightening for its custard-green coloring and fractal swirls that give it the appearance of an ancient Thai pagoda. Or a prog-rock album cover. It has a milder, less sulfurous flavor than cauliflower or broccoli.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span class="calibre5">The humdrum origins of the artichoke—it’s the flower of a thistle—belie its wondrous and complex flavor. See Globe Artichoke &amp; Lamb below for a full description. Globe artichokes contain a phenolic compound called cynarin, which has the peculiar effect of making anything you eat directly afterwards taste sweet. It temporarily inhibits the sweet receptors in your taste buds, so that when you follow a bite of artichoke with, say, a sip of water, flushing the compound off your tongue, the receptors start working again and the abrupt contrast fools the brain into thinking you’ve just swallowed a mouthful of sugar solution. This makes for a diverting, if swiftly tedious, party game—sweet radicchio!—but it’s bad news for wine. And the enemy of wine is my enemy. The problem can be minimized by using ingredients that create a bridge between the wine and the artichoke (or simply taking a bite of something else before you take a sip of wine). Or you could ditch the wine altogether and drink Cynar, an artichoke-flavored liqueur from Italy.</span></span></p>

We had been arguing with such uninterrupted intensity that it was only a promising road sign that reminded us that it was well past lunchtime and we were hungry. Our motherly Italian hostess, perhaps picking up on the friction between us, took pity and led us to a table under an olive tree. Mercifully soon, she brought a label-less bottle of cold, dry white wine, an enormous spoon and a terracotta dish of something covered in breadcrumbs and cheese, molten bubbles popping on the surface like the meniscus of a volcano. My boyfriend, or ex-boyfriend, or whatever he was at that moment, took the spoon and, breaking through the crust, emerged with a steaming heap of rigatoni, pancetta and artichokes, in a rich béchamel savory-sweet with Parmesan. They say hunger is the best sauce, but if that lunch under the olive tree is anything to go by, the point in a relationship where </span></span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">it doesn’t matter any more</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre5"> runs it a close second. We smiled at each other. I topped up our glasses. He piled the pasta on our plates. The bitter, nutty greenness of the artichoke cut through the richness of pancetta and cheese. It was by far the best last date I’ve ever had. If </span></span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">your</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre5"> relationship is on the rocks, get 8 oz rigatoni on to cook. Soften a finely chopped onion and 2 garlic cloves in olive oil with 3 oz sliced pancetta. Add 4–6 cooked artichoke bottoms (good jar ones will do), sliced into sixths. In a bowl, mix ½ cup milk with 2/3 cup heavy cream and 2 oz grated Parmesan. The pasta should be </span></span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">al dente</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre5"> by now. Drain it, empty back into the pan and add the milky, creamy, cheesy mixture and the onion and artichokes. Stir and check for seasoning, then transfer to a baking dish. Cut a ball of mozzarella into slices and lay them on top. Cover with a mixture of 2 oz breadcrumbs and 1 oz grated Parmesan and bake for 30 minutes at 400°F, covering it with foil if it looks in danger of burning. Serve with a bottle of cold, cheap Italian white.</span></span></p>

The flavor is wonderful, but the magic really resides in the texture—dense, yielding and velvety, it’s the foie gras of vegetables. Artichokes are a spring vegetable in Italy and Spain, and make a seasonal pairing with lamb, especially in stews. Lamb seems to mellow the vegetable’s bitterness in a way that beef and pork don’t. The only drawback to lamb and artichoke stew is having to peel and chop globe artichokes. You end up looking as if you’ve been playing patty-cake with Edward Scissorhands.

It’s a little fussy for both cook and diner, but the flavor combination is terrific and, allowed to infiltrate its leaves, pork lends artichoke an irresistible sticky saltiness. I combine them in a pie. Drain and rinse a jar of artichoke hearts, cut them each in half and pat dry. Line an 8-in pie pan with shortcrust pastry and spread ½ lb sausage meat over it. Arrange the artichokes on top, then cover with another ½ lb sausage meat. Cover with a pastry lid, seal the edges and make a little hole in the center. Bake for an hour at 350°F. Best eaten cold with plenty of salad and pickles.</span></span></p>

Jerusalem artichokes would arguably be more popular if they weren’t so famously difficult to digest. A combination of globe artichoke and potato is kinder on the stomach. In Provence, they’re thinly sliced and baked together in olive oil and garlic (Escoffier ritzed the dish up by substituting truffle for garlic and butter for olive oil). Or you might pair them cold in a salad with a mayonnaise deliciously enhanced with flesh scraped from the cooked leaves. In Italy the two are combined in soup and, according to </span></span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">The Silver Spoon</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre5">, in a pie.</span></span></p>

You might remove a cooked globe artichoke’s tough outer leaves, purple inner leaves and hairy choke to create a “cup” in which to serve crab, lobster or shrimp in mayonnaise or vinaigrette. Or make a hot dip by mixing thin slices of cooked artichoke heart with crabmeat, mayonnaise, finely chopped shallot and grated Parmesan and baking under a herb crumb crust. Eat fresh from the oven with crackers. Hearty enough for an iron smelter’s cocktail party.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span class="calibre5">Salty dairy ingredients are a heavenly match for asparagus: butter, Parmesan and hollandaise sauce simultaneously contrast with and enhance its sweet, sulfurous vegetable flavor. Other sulfurous-tasting foods, such as eggs, crustaceans and garlic, also make harmonious partners. Thin spears of asparagus are called sprue, and tend to have a more piquant flavor than the full-grown variety. White asparagus is grown from the same seed as green but is covered with soil to inhibit the production of chlorophyll. It’s pretty much as flavorless as it is lacking in color, and while its apologists describe it as subtle, mild or “dainty,” I can’t find a whole lot to like in a slimy, anemic tube free of the rich nuttiness that makes proper green asparagus such a treat. For some reason, the Spanish, who have so much to recommend them gastronomically, put it in salads, where it lies hidden among the leaves like a chef’s long-forgotten finger.</span></span></p>

When cooked, asparagus develops a strong sulfurous-sweet characteristic that goes particularly well with black truffle. Analysis of truffle extract reveals that it contains traces of male-pig sex pheromones, which is thought to account for the sow’s happy acquiescence when dragged about the woods all day snuffling in the undergrowth. By all means, make this for your date, but if they like it, you might ask yourself what this says about them.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span class="calibre5">Side-by-side tastings reveal that hen eggs vary noticeably in their flavor characteristics. If you’re lucky, you’ll find one with a buttery, naturally salty yolk that makes a mild but very satisfying dipping sauce when soft boiled. Different egg flavors are mainly attributable to their age and storage conditions, although they can also be due to variations in the bird’s diet. Some claim that the rare and expensive gull’s egg has a fishy flavor (as, apparently, does the penguin’s), and that goose and pheasant eggs are gamier, although I can’t say I’ve ever been able to detect either of these. Quail and duck eggs are often described as creamy, but this is mainly attributable to their higher yolk-to-white ratio.</span></span></p>

There’s something in the citrusy, pine tang of celery that really lifts egg’s sulfurous low notes.

Gull’s eggs cost about ten times as much as hen’s, not only because of the shortness of the laying season but because just a limited number of collector’s licenses are granted. Celery salt is, of course, widely available to buy, but you can make your own by lightly toasting celery seeds and crushing them with sea salt. Start with a 1:6 mix and adjust to taste. Fergus Henderson, by contrast, makes celery salt by baking grated celeriac with salt, and puts a wintry spin on the combination by making a series of dents in a pile of hot, buttery mashed celeriac, placing an egg in each and baking until the white is firm and the yolk just runny.</span></span></p>

It’s like coming in from the cold. The initial warm shock of nutmeg gives way to soothing, thickened milk and the afterglow of rum. And this eggnog tart is so delicious it’s threatening to usurp Christmas pudding. Scald 2/3 cup heavy cream. Whisk 3 egg yolks with 1/3 cup superfine sugar, a pinch of salt and a generous grating of nutmeg. Slowly whisk the cream into the eggs. Pour into a clean pan and cook gently, stirring constantly, until the mixture is thick enough to coat the back of the spoon. Remove from the heat and set aside. Thoroughly dissolve 2 tsp gelatin powder in 4 tsp hot water and stir into the custard. Add 3 tbsp rum, 1 tbsp brandy and ½ tsp vanilla extract, stir again, then strain into a glass or ceramic bowl. Grate in a little more nutmeg and put in the fridge. Before the custard sets, whisk the 3 egg whites to soft peaks. Fold them into the custard and pour into a baked, deep sweet pastry shell, 9 inches in diameter. Chill until set. Serve at room temperature, with plenty more freshly grated nutmeg on top. This also works on a crushed cookie base.</span></span></p>

In China, egg fried rice is considered a meal in its own right, not just an accompaniment, and so it should be. It’s quite delicious even reduced to three basic ingredients—rice, egg and peas—but add a few more and you have the mandate of heaven. Finely chop a couple of slices of smoked bacon and a small onion and fry them in 2 tbsp peanut oil. Add about 4 handfuls of cold, cooked white rice and give it a good stir to break up the grains. Scatter over a handful of peas and, once all is well heated, drizzle the mixture with 2 beaten eggs and a shake of soy sauce. Allow the egg to cook, giving it a turn now and then. The flavor can only improve if you invest in a carbon-steel or cast-iron wok and season it properly. To the Chinese, the wok is an ingredient in itself, and skilled chefs can impart a quality to dishes that the Cantonese describe as “wok hay,” or “wok breath”—a combination of flavor, heat and smokiness that comes of knowing how to get the best out of your pan.</span></span></p>

You have to boil and shell the crab and eggs, clean out the crab shell, finely chop the egg whites, sieve the yolks, finely chop the brown meat and mix it with mayonnaise, and mix lemon juice into the white meat. The brown meat is then layered in the bottom of the crab shell with the white meat and chopped egg arranged on top in defined bands, as in a flag. It’s dressed with parsley and served with a little extra mayo on the side. You eat the white meat first, appreciating its pale delicacy before moving on to the hard stuff. The brown meat is part of the crab’s digestive system and contains all the flavor that implies. If all this sounds more trouble than it’s worth, crab Louis is a less fussy recipe that originated on the West Coast of the United States in the early twentieth century. It’s a white crabmeat and egg salad with lettuce and a “Louis” dressing that’s very similar to Thousand Island.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span class="calibre5">This section covers bivalves and crustaceans, but oysters have their own chapter <a href="#dummy_split_013.html#filepos670323">*</a>. Mussels and clams have a saltier, stronger flavor than sweet shrimp, lobster and scallop. Crab lies somewhere in between, depending on how much of the brown meat, which has a deeper marine flavor, you mix in with the white. The food writer Alan Davidson noted that the white claw and leg meat of crab is similar in flavor and texture to lobster. Lobster might be held in higher regard, particularly by those for whom the price is immaterial, but plenty of people consider crab to be comparable, if not superior. Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall takes the view that while lobster costs five times as much as crab, it isn’t five times more delicious.</span></span></p>

Once picked, it starts to consume its own sugar—more voraciously than any other common vegetable—flattening out the flavor. At its tender best, asparagus is green heaven with shrimp or sweet, fresh crab. If you’re ever in England in May or June, pack up a camping stove with some plates, cutlery, a pan and some salt and head for the Suffolk coast. Keep your eyes peeled for signs advertising pick-your-own asparagus. Harvest a couple of bundles and strike on for the sea at Southwold or Aldeburgh. While one of you cusses over the stove, the other can buy fresh crab from one of the tar-black fishermen’s huts. You’ll also need some good bread, salty butter, a couple of lemons and a cold bottle of Fumé Blanc. And some early strawberries. Locate each other on the beach. Get some water on to boil and add the asparagus to it. Butter the bread. Open the wine. Quarter the lemons. When the asparagus is just cooked, dot it with butter and serve with plenty of crabmeat. Stare, shivering, toward Holland, as the tide fizzes on the pebbles and the gulls announce the onset of British summertime.</span></span></p>

They’re fine—beef’s flavor tends to be intensified by marine partners such as anchovy and oyster—but I find the combination of lean, dense flesh can add up to a chewy chore. And I’m not convinced that the beef does much for the lobster in return. The basic idea has, of course, been reinterpreted by various chefs as scallops with foie gras, octopus with bone marrow and monkfish tail with oxtail. And in the late 1980s the term was applied by my hungrier male colleagues to the blow-out combination of a Big Mac and a Filet-O-Fish. Alligator meat, incidentally, is said to taste like a hybrid of shellfish and veal. See also Oyster &amp; Beef, <a href="#dummy_split_013.html#filepos673210">*</a>.</span></span></p>

One evening on vacation, we stopped in Porto Ercole, on a mountainous peninsula connected to the Tuscan mainland by three dams like strands of mozzarella. After a swim in the warm sea, we drifted toward the restaurant—similarly adrift on a precariously tethered pontoon—that was playing the best music. No one else was around. The Italians would only just be digesting their lunch, but we’d driven all the way up from Rome, and the swim and the first glass of Soave had given us an appetite. We were debating how long we might be able to hold off eating when an enormous man with long, sun-ruined hair and a moustache to match sat down at our table. “Hi,” he said, in slightly Americanized Italo-English that somehow sounded Swiss. “What would you like to eat? I’ll cook you anything.” This was a little like asking the young Hannibal if he fancied conquering any bits of the Roman Empire. I generally want </span></span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">everything</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre5">. But we were by the sea, in Italy, and that can mean only one thing: s</span></span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">paghetti alle vongole</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre5">. In short order, we were sitting in front of golden, tangled masses of garlicky pasta caught up with creamy, chewy clams, like Venus’s hair before she’d had the chance to comb it through. Sprigs of flat-leaf parsley lifted the oily richness. I have a fairy godfather, and he’s a chef the size of a grizzly bear who lives on a floating restaurant.</span></span></p>

You can still see the boats huddled together on the shore in the evening. It was a summer-vacation ritual of my childhood to help my father pick out the best live shellfish from the fishery’s tank after eating crab sandwiches in a converted sardine cellar nearby. The brown crab caught on the Cornish coast has a deep, seaweedy flavor, and in its shell looks, rather fittingly, like a pasty with legs. When it’s fresh, it needs nothing but a squeeze of lemon juice backcombed through the meat to enhance its sweetness. The same goes for all shellfish, really, whether raw on a stand of </span></span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">fruits de mer</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre5"> or grilled on a platter of octopus and langoustines.

Overfishing is a problem, and farmed conch is more tender to the teeth, if less flavorful, than the wild kind.</span></span></p>

The magic of the dish is not just the chewy little nuggets of clam but the precious juice inside their shells, which, as is the case with oysters, contributes an essential part of the flavor. One doubtful theory on how this combination arose is that Portugal’s pigs, left to wander its long coastline, had a lot of seafood in their diet, with the consequence that their meat had a fishy taste that the locals covered up by cooking it with clams. But it’s just as likely to have come about because shellfish and pork were abundantly available and the combination is delicious—so much so that it’s traveled to Macau, a former Portuguese colony where several variations on the dish are eaten.</span></span></p>

Monkfish used to be cut into shrimp shapes, coated in crumbs and passed off as scampi. Then someone realized that if it could be passed off as shellfish it might be rather good in its own right, and in the 1990s it increased in price and popularity to the extent that it is now on the endangered list. Jane Grigson notes that monkfish is often compared to lobster, which isn’t, in her opinion, fair to either side, even if monkfish was her favorite fish to cook and eat after “the four greats”—sole, turbot, eel and lobster. Lobster and monkfish certainly have a textural similarity (they’re both pleasantly chewy), and taste tests reveal that the flavor of monkfish does bear comparison with shellfish, especially in the dark, gelatinous flesh nearer the skin. Monkfish aside, John Dory and turbot are classically served with shellfish sauce, and a few mussels or clams cooked with peas in butter and white wine make a beautiful brothy sauce for any white fish.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span class="calibre5">The flavor of saltwater fish is a result of its own delicate balancing act. On average, the salinity of seawater ranges from 3 to 3.5 percent by weight. As Harold McGee points out, animals need to keep the total level of dissolved minerals in their cells closer to 1 percent, and so sea fish offset the saltiness of their environment by filling their cells with other compounds, namely amino acids and amines, which have their own taste and flavor implications. Glycine, an amino acid, lends sweetness, whereas the glutamic acid present in shellfish, tuna and anchovies “is savory and mouthfilling.” Many fin fish, however, offset the salt water flowing through their bodies with the relatively flavorless amine, trimethylamine oxide, or TMAO, which is why, in contrast to strong-flavored fish such as anchovy, most white fish are characterized by sleep-inducing flavor descriptors like “mild,” “sweet” and “delicate.” White fish are so often entombed in batter or slathered in sauce that it’s worth trying a plate of three or four different kinds, simply fried or steamed. Once your powers of perception have acclimatized, you’ll find the subtly different flavors begin to show up against the white like landmarks in a snowscape. Look out for gamy, musty, earthy and seaweedy notes. Cod can have a slightly sour, salty, cooked-potato quality, which is perhaps why it’s such a hit with French fries. Monkfish can be sweet and buttery, a little shellfishy, without the full buttered-popcorn flavor of shrimp. Good sea bass is meaty, Brazil-nutty, with a faint metallic twang to match its fuse-wire gray veins. Fish covered in this chapter include cod, skate, sole, flounder, plaice, monkfish and turbot.</span></span></p>

The benefits of cooking fish with bacon fat are not to be underestimated. A little pot of rendered bacon fat is worth having in the fridge. It’s good with fish, cabbage and for baking cornbread. I think of it as a cross between cooking fat and stock because it has such an enriching flavor. Buy 1 lb very fatty bacon and chop it up into lardoons or slices (there’ll be bacon meat to use up once you’re finished, so cut lardoons if you’re tossing it with blue cheese in a salad, slices if you’re planning a breakfast or club sandwich). Cook the fat over a low heat in a frying pan with ¼ cup water. Be patient: it will take at least 30 minutes. When it looks as if all the water has evaporated and all the fat melted, cool a little, then strain into a ceramic or glass storage jar and keep in the fridge.</span></span></p>

Fish and cheese are, of course, paired in French dishes, like skate with a Gruyère sauce, or bouillabaisse with grated Gruyère sunk into its depths. The British grate Cheddar on mashed-potato-topped fish pie to give it a flavor boost, while the Americans pair tuna with cheese in their classic toasted tuna-melt sandwich.

<p><span><span class="calibre5">1.  “Fish” and “chips” is not necessarily </span></span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">fish and chips</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre5">. To qualify as the real thing—i.e., an essentially unitary quantity, </span></span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">fishandchips</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre5">, wherein the chips (thick potato fries) are inseparable from the fish as opposed to just served with it—it has to come from an outlet known as a chip shop or chippy. This is not only for sentimental reasons. To achieve the essential crispness of the chip, and to cook enough pieces of battered fish at one time to stop them losing heat or going soggy, you need the sort of hard-core double-frying equipment rarely found outside the dedicated chip shop.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span class="calibre5">2.  A chippy serves fish and chips, mushy peas, fishcakes, saveloys, battered sausages and pickles. At a stretch, meat pies. Avoid opportunistic “fish bars” that offer burgers, fried chicken, kebabs or pizzas.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span class="calibre5">3.  Salt and malt vinegar are essential. Other types of vinegar are not acceptable.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span class="calibre5">4.  The fish and chips must be served wrapped in proper chip-shop paper, which to the uninitiated looks, feels and most importantly smells like newsless newspaper, and is the secret ingredient in proper chip-shop fish and chips. It seasons them. If they’re served in Styrofoam boxes, eat elsewhere.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span class="calibre5">5.  Fish and chips must be eaten in appropriate surroundings. To be truly authentic you should be eating your fish and chips by the sea, or at the bus stop, or perched on the wall outside a gas station, breathing steam into your hand because you couldn’t wait for the chips to cool down.</span></span></p>

Fresh thyme is a safer bet than dried, which can be too strong for fish. Lemon thyme obviously makes an excellent match.</span></span></p>

</div>
<p><span><span class="calibre5">An oyster’s flavor is more than usually expressive of the environment that supported it. The cleanliness, mineral content and temperature of the water are important factors, and account for the common practice of identifying oysters by provenance rather than species. For example, </span></span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">Ostrea edulis</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre5">, the “European flat” or “native” oyster, is variously referred to as the English Colchester, the Irish Galway, the protected Belon and the algae-trimmed Marennes from France. They have also been successfully maricultured in California and Maine. Order a mixed platter of oysters and hold off on the lemon while you try to detect the flavor notes connoisseurs have identified: sweet, creamy, meaty, buttery, nutty, melon, melon rind, cucumber, mineral, metallic, coppery and, of course, briny or oceanic. To experience its sweeter, more complex flavors beyond the initial shock of seawater, you’ll need to give your oyster a chew before it slips down. Sour flavors like lemon and vinegar dampen an oyster’s saltiness and highlight its sweetness. Horseradish, or the chili-spiked tomato ketchup known as cocktail sauce, makes for a hot-sweet-salt combination wherein the oyster also contributes its inherent umami. Oyster sauce is a thick, dark, salty condiment from China; brands vary in the quantity of oyster extractives, sugar, sodium and flavor enhancers they contain.</span></span></p>

But it wasn’t only to bulk out the more expensive ingredients that oysters were added to steak and kidney pudding. The salty oyster bolsters the flavor of beef.

It was the kind of place where you’d think twice about eating the breadsticks, let alone take your chances with the seafood. It didn’t kill me, nor did it convert me. I ate my second in a bar in the French Quarter of New Orleans, a narrow, funereal room, cooled by an apathetic ceiling fan, neon signs fighting a losing battle against the gloom. A dive brasserie: exactly what I’d been hoping for. With his eyes half on the muted football game, a barman in sleeve clips shoveled oysters from an ice-filled trough in the bar and shunted them croupier-style toward the punters. The scene had the paradoxical exoticism of another culture’s routine: everyone was bored except me. I raised a finger. The barman pushed an oyster my way. It was unlike any oyster I’d seen: a dark gray, shiny oval, monstrous as a whale’s eye. It stared me down. I gave it a squirt of hot sauce and, trying to blank my mind, picked it up by its deep, craggy socket and swallowed it whole. I felt my scalp crackle. High on the oyster’s dose of zinc, or the fiery sauce, or simply because I’d looked the beast in the eye and defeated it, I ordered a celebratory beer. And as it cooled my raging throat, the barman pushed something else my way. Bigger, grayer and shinier, and this time there were two of them.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span class="calibre5">Oscietra is the caviar of choice for the connoisseur: fine, nutty, complex and (some say) herbal in flavor. As with any natural product, the flavor can vary wildly, especially given the Oscietra sturgeon’s omnivorous nature and its habit of evading predators by diving to the seabed, which together make its diet particularly wide. Carnivorous Beluga, whose protein-rich diet may account for the greater size of its eggs, produces a creamier, less fishy-tasting caviar. Sevruga is the commonest—or least rare—and is as black as model-village tarmac. It has a less complex, more strongly sea-salty flavor. Some estimate that stocks of Caspian Sea sturgeon may be entirely depleted by 2012. Some farmed caviars from America and Europe are nonetheless starting to receive outstanding reviews for their flavor.</span></span></p>

They certainly share a decaying-frigate palette of gray, green, rust and black, and one might put any proximity in flavor down to their similar bottom-feeding habits. One of Thomas Keller’s signature dishes is oysters topped with caviar served on tapioca pearls in a vermouth sabayon. At Noma in Copenhagen, chef René Redzepi, who worked under Keller at The French Laundry, makes a caviar of gelled oyster juice and serves it on a tapioca pudding.</span></span></p>

White foods certainly look fantastic with caviar, drawing attention to its iridescence by bouncing light onto each taut egg, just as white fur complements high cheekbones. Try these mini caviar cheesecakes. Using a small pastry cutter, press 1-in circles from a ½-in-thick slice of dark rye bread. Leave the cutter in place while you spoon in a ½-in depth of cream cheese and a dollop of caviar. Ease off the cutter, taking care to keep the cheesecake in shape.

Flavor expert François Benzi noted that the two ingredients share flavor compounds that might explain their compatibility. This led Blumenthal to research the harmoniousness of pairings with compounds in common, and to conclude that while shared organo-chemical ground can often account for the compatibility of existing pairings, and, conversely, suggest unlikely pairings that turn out to work—coffee and garlic, for instance, or parsley and banana—there’s no replacement for imagination and intuition. To me, the combination of caviar and white chocolate is like a heightened version of Alain Senderens’ pairing of lobster and vanilla. The flavor of white chocolate is predominantly vanilla, with a slightly buttery, cream-cheesy quality that would make it all the more harmonious with the fish eggs.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span class="calibre5">Oily fish are richer and more strongly flavored than white fish. Classic flavor affinities, such as gooseberry or horseradish with mackerel, cucumber with salmon, and watercress with trout, seek to cut through the fattiness. Lemon serves this function too, as well as deodorizing some of the stronger fishy aromas. Cilantro and/or lime juice are used to the same effect in Asian dishes. Briny capers, olives, prosciutto and shellfish bring out the sweeter side in sea-salty oily fish such as mackerel, herring, sardines and red mullet. This chapter also covers earthier-tasting freshwater fish and diadromous fish (i.e., species that live in both salt- and freshwater), like salmon, trout, grayling and eel, plus meatier-flavored swordfish and tuna.

The fennel catches and emits a puff of anise-scented smoke. Great, if you have a dine-in kitchen, where everyone can enjoy the aroma while you whip the fish off the singed twigs onto a warm serving plate. Equally sensational, if more fetishistic than rustic, is Heston Blumenthal’s salmon in a tight, shiny, black licorice gel—a recipe he developed when exploring the combination of asparagus and licorice.</span></span></p>

It’s certainly served the same way, with butter or hollandaise sauce, often as an accompaniment to seafood, especially salmon. As I write this, both are in season and the samphire is four times the price of the asparagus.</span></span></p>

As the availability of raw tuna was seasonally limited in Los Angeles, Ichiro Mashita and Teruo Imaizumi, sushi chefs at Tokyo Kaikan, tried combining king crab, cucumber and ginger with avocado, on the basis that it has a buttery texture and dense fattiness somewhat reminiscent of fresh tuna. Avocados grow year-round in California, which was just as well, as it turned out Mashita and Imaizumi had invented a dish that was not only hugely popular in its own right but became a sort of training sushi; once they’d got used to the seaweed and cold, compacted rice, diners went on to try the more authentic stuff.</span></span></p>

Elizabeth David said they are one of the nicest small fish for frying. The eighteenth-century cookery writer Hannah Glasse suggested frying them in breadcrumbs and serving with fried parsley and melted butter. Along with sweet, sour, metallic, buttery notes, salmon also has a cucumber aroma when fresh, although this recedes with cooking and is replaced with a boiled-potato character. Interesting to note that the traditional accompaniments to poached salmon, boiled new potatoes and a cucumber garnish, have a deeper affinity for the fish than you might think.</span></span></p>

Gravlax, probably the most famous, is salmon cured with sugar and salt, flavored with dill and mustard, then served with more dill and mustard in the form of a sauce. The Swedish mustard used is sweeter, creamier and less pungent than Dijon or English varieties. Alan Davidson gives recipes for gravad mackerel (not as delicious as the salmon, he notes, but still pretty good), and for </span></span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">makrillsopa</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre5">, a simple preparation of mackerel, dill, water, milk, peppercorns and possibly some potato. In the United States, dill is used in tuna salad sandwiches, for which freeze-dried dill works just fine. My favorite dill and fish idea comes from Nigel Slater, and isn’t much more work than making a sandwich. Put 2 salmon steaks in a small baking dish and cover with a mixture of 1 very, very finely chopped onion, 1 tbsp lemon juice, 1 tbsp chopped dill and ½ cup sour cream or crème fraîche. Bake at 425°F for 15–18 minutes (just long enough to boil some new potatoes) and scatter with more chopped dill before serving.</span></span></p>

Chunks of seared tuna may share their canned counterpart’s affinity for egg, capers, green beans and potatoes but they lack the flaky, messy texture that is essential if the fish is to meld with the dressing and loose crumbs of egg yolk and infiltrate the entire salad, as opposed to sitting haughtily on top of it. If you’re looking to impress, then Tre Torri’s canned Ventresca brand, which uses tuna belly, has a buttery, creamy character that makes it a world-class treat, according to the food writer David Rosengarten. Mind you, he rates it so highly as to recommend eating it by itself, using a less exalted variety for salads—understandable when you consider that Ventresca costs roughly 20 times as much as a standard supermarket brand.</span></span></p>

It’s thought to have been a Greek invention, but the Romans were famously mad for garum, using it with all meats and fishes in much the same way that fish and oyster sauces are used in Asian cooking. A few salted anchovy fillets in a beef stew, or pushed into slits in a roasting joint, will perform a similar function. Don’t worry if you’re so-so about the flavor of anchovy: cooked like this, the fishiness disappears in favor of an intense savoriness that makes the beef taste meatier and somehow juicier. Cooks talk of anchovy adding an extra dimension, say in a spicy beef broth for a Vietnamese </span></span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">pho bo</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre5">. Long cooking isn’t essential; an anchovy and garlic butter will enhance the flavor of a steak. Alternatively, you could make a Thai weeping tiger salad by pouring a fish-sauce–based dressing, like the one in Lime &amp; Anchovy, <a href="#dummy_split_020.html#filepos1371976">*</a>, over slices of seared beef steak.</span></span></p>

But it’s indispensable to this popular Italian pasta dish. The rich saltiness of the anchovies contrasts with the bittersweet broccoli to luxurious effect—especially if you use the purple sprouting kind, which retains the sauce in its head and its frilly leaves. In a frying pan, dissolve 6 anchovy fillets in 2 tbsp warm olive oil (not hot—you don’t want to fry them). Add some chopped garlic, chili flakes and a bridesmaid’s posy of cooked broccoli florets. Push the broccoli around the pan to coat it in the sauce and then serve tossed with pasta. If you top it all off with grated Parmesan, you’ll have a dish fit for a peasant king.</span></span></p>

Scatter sliced onions and anchovy fillets over the bottom of a buttered shallow baking dish and cover with fat matchsticks of potato. Pour in just enough cream to cover the potatoes, then top with breadcrumbs and dot with butter. Cover with foil and bake at 400°F for 25 minutes, then remove the foil and cook for another 20 minutes. I imagine Jansson as a melancholic Stockholm detective, whose sole comfort, like real ale for Morse, is a steaming plate of salty, creamy potatoes, served by a silent blonde waitress in a dark tavern by the sea.</span></span></p>

<div class="calibre21">
 
</div>
<p><span><span class="calibre5">Smoked flavor is imparted by compounds including guaiacol, which has an aromatic, sweet, smoked-sausage taste, and eugenol, the main flavor component in clove. (Incidentally, both guaiacol and eugenol are found in barrel-aged wines, which is why fish pie and oaked Chardonnay are such natural companions.) You might also detect leathery, medicinal, fruity, whisky, cinnamon, caramel and vanilla notes in smoked foods. Exactly what flavor characteristics are promoted depends on how the raw ingredients were prepared. For example, ungutted fish such as bloaters will end up tasting gamier than gutted fish. The nature of the smoking process itself is another factor, including the type of wood used and the length of the smoke. Not that your herring has necessarily seen any more wood than the pencil tucked behind the delivery boy’s ear. A flavoring called liquid smoke is often used in lieu of the time-consuming, expensive smoking process, not only for seafood but for meats and tofu too. In the United States you can buy it off the supermarket shelf as a poke in the ribs for your barbecue beans. This chapter covers smoked salmon, trout, mackerel, haddock, eel and herring.</span></span></p>

At his restaurant in Los Angeles, Wolfgang Puck combines smoked salmon and caviar on a signature pizza. Re-create something similar by brushing a pizza base with garlic and chili oil, scattering it with onions and baking in the oven. Meanwhile, stir finely chopped shallots, dill and lemon juice into sour cream. When the base is crisp, remove, allow to cool, then cover with the sour cream mixture and a fairly comprehensive draping of smoked salmon.

Potato bulks out the meal, of course, but also calms the rude flavor, which would have made it particularly welcome in pre-refrigeration days, when stronger cures were used to make the fish last longer. It’s a testament to the fishcake that it’s outlived these practicalities and made it onto the menus of some of the world’s most fashionable restaurants, as has smoked fish chowder, or the similar Scottish soup known as cullen skink.</span></span></p>

</div>
<p><span><span class="calibre5">One of the world’s best seasonings. Some people believe that there isn’t a flavor that bacon doesn’t enhance. Smoked bacon has a stronger, saltier, spicier flavor than unsmoked. Streaky is more fatty, and the fat is both more flavorsome and sweeter than the lean. For these reasons, just one slice of smoked streaky bacon in a soup or stew can give a far more delicious result than a stock cube could ever hope to. Salty bacon brings out the sweetness of other ingredients and takes the edge off their bitterness. The aroma and flavor of cooked bacon is famously provocative to vegetarians, but synthetic vegetarian/kosher bacon flavor is available in the form of crisp pieces, bacon salt and a bacon-flavor mayonnaise. This chapter also covers cooked ham. For more about smoked flavors, see the introduction to Smoked Fish on <a href="#dummy_split_014.html#filepos732300">*</a>.</span></span></p>

To preserve meat meant smoking it intensively, lending it a rasping pungency unfamiliar to the modern palate. Degrees of smokiness are, however, still one of the main distinguishing features of bacons and hams. Eugenol, which gives cloves their characteristic flavor, is one of the compounds imparted to food by the smoking process, and I was curious to see how differently a dish (in this case, Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall’s barbecue beans) might turn out made with smoked bacon and with unsmoked bacon and cloves. I soaked 1 lb dried beans overnight, then slowly simmered half of them with ½ lb smoked bacon chopped into bite-sized pieces, 2 small onions, quartered, 1 tbsp molasses, and 1 heaped tsp English mustard. To the other ½ pound of beans, I added ½ lb unsmoked bacon, and the same quantities of the other ingredients as for smoked, with the addition of two cloves. In the unsmoked-plus-clove version, all the ingredients kept their separate identities, the clove flavor trailing just behind the others much as the toddler spaceships follow the mother ship in </span></span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">Close Encounters of the Third Kind</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre5">. In the smoked version, by contrast, the smoke flavor got into everything, even under the beans’ skin. It was sharper, meatier and quite the better of the two.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span class="calibre5">Although the Italian word prosciutto </span></span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">can</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre5"> apply to cooked ham, in this book the term is used more generically to refer to raw, cured hams primarily from Italy and Spain. Spanish Serrano ham is considered such a delicacy that some say the only thing worthy to share a plate with it is more Serrano ham. The practice of serving fruit with dry-cured ham is better suited to gentler Parma or San Daniele ham, as sweet and softly salty as a kiss from Botticelli’s Venus. Serrano is more like a snog from Titian’s Bacchus on the way back from getting legless in the woods. The difference is in part down to variations in the production process. During aging, mold growth is encouraged on Serrano hams, creating mushroomy, foresty flavors, while in Parma ham mold growth is curtailed. Fat is rubbed on Parma ham to help it retain its moisture, whereas the moisture in Serrano is allowed to evaporate, concentrating the flavors. Harold McGee notes that the nitrites used in Spanish ham production are absent in Parma and San Daniele, stimulating the development of more fruity esters than are found in Serrano.</span></span></p>

You drop your car off in a quiet station—rather eerily frequented only by cars—and are shuttled back to Avignon, or whichever city you’re traveling from, to while away the few hours before the passenger train leaves, unburdened by suitcases, car keys, cases of wine, glass jars of duck confit or strings of flour-dusted saucissons. So unburdened, in fact, that I have without fail had to run, shoes in hand, for the train before it leaves at 11 p.m. I’m never so disorganized, however, that I don’t buy bread, Bayonne ham, a bottle of Chateauneuf-du-Pape and a tub of creamy, crunchy, mustardy celeriac remoulade. A last-night-of-the-vacation atmosphere invariably obtains in the Motorail bar, and a late, shared snack is always welcome before you retire to your couchette at 3 a.m. to dream that you’re sleeping on a train.

Prosciutto and melon are, of course, a classically harmonious flavor pairing, and so simple to prepare. Orange cantaloupe is the most common choice but a less heady Galia can be as good, if not better. Whichever cultivar you use, don’t overwhelm the ham with huge briquettes of melon, or use underripe melons—the lovely, buttery texture of a ripe melon is half the point of the pairing. But then it shouldn’t be so ripe that its aroma catches like hair spray at the back of your throat. Make sure that neither the melon nor the ham is too cold. But then they shouldn’t be warm either. And don’t plate too far in advance of serving. The salt in the prosciutto is liable to draw out the melon juice, leaving you with spoiled, soggy meat.

Other than oversalting, it’s quite hard to mess this combination up; the most difficult thing will be sourcing good, affordable prosciutto. My local deli sells rough offcuts of Serrano ham. They’re hard and chewy and great for soup—that’s if I manage to get them home. It’s all too easy to eat them one by one out of the bag as if they were dark, salty toffees.</span></span></p>

Sure, it tastes good, what with the ham’s donation of fat, flavor and saltiness to the lean, light flavor of white fish, but there are more plentiful fish that take to the treatment just as well, even if they don’t slice into neat rounds like monkfish. A similar flavor, incidentally, can be achieved with some fish without using prosciutto. Scale and clean a skin-on fillet of sea bass or black bream, then run the back of a knife along it, like a window cleaner’s squeegee, to remove the moisture. Salt and leave at room temperature for 15 minutes, then give it another scrape and pat dry. Place the fillet skin-side down in hot oil, cook for a few minutes, then flip for a quick final cook or finish in the oven. Properly crisped, the skin is as salty, flavorful and texturally pleasing as bacon and a delicious contrast to the soft, creamy flesh. Works on oily fish such as salmon and trout, too.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span class="calibre5">Black olives are ripe green olives and are thus sweeter. Green olives tend to be sour. Both are naturally bitter, which is why to be palatable they need to be cured. Proper curing is a slow process. The fruit is packed in salt, or sun-dried, before being steeped in brine for months. By contrast, the industrial process, in which the olives are preserved in lye solution, takes less than a day. Both the traditional and industrial processes draw out the olive’s bitter glucosides, but in the latter too much of the flavor is lost too. Find a good olive supplier and you can appreciate the variety of cultivars available, each with their own flavor and textural characteristics: Gaeta, a small, wrinkled, dry-cured olive from Italy that has a slight dried-fruit/plum flavor; Nyons, also dry-cured, then aged in brine, with a pleasingly leathery, slightly nutty flavor; tart, crunchy Picholine, a green olive that puts up a satisfyingly crisp resistance to the teeth and will cut through fattier meats in much the same way as cornichons; and Lucques, a gently flavored, buttery green olive from the South of France, touched with almond and avocado flavors. Olive oil encompasses a similarly broad range of flavors, from the mild and sweet to the dark, peppery and throat-catching. As a rule, pressings of early fruit produce greener, more peppery oils; the later, riper olives, softer flavors. Cook with the cheaper stuff and save expensive oil for salads, or for use as a sauce over warm vegetables. Flavor notes in olive oil include floral, melon, apple, butter, pepper, artichoke, herbal, tomato leaf, green leaves, green banana, avocado and grass, which leads us neatly on to the next section, Green &amp; Grassy <a href="#dummy_split_015.html#filepos797598">*</a>.</span></span></p>

Kalamata, from the Peloponnese city of the same name, are cured in red wine vinegar and brine, and have a similar strength of character to the cheese, but a juicy, vinous flavor that cuts through it too. Chop the feta, and some peeled, seeded cucumber and tomato, into 1-in chunks. Slice red onion into thin separated rings. Keep the olives whole. Dress with grassy Greek olive oil, red wine vinegar and a shake of dried oregano. Like bacon, even average feta is pleasingly fatty and salty, and the temptation can be to make do. But—like bacon—it also keeps well, and so it’s worth stocking up when you can get your hands on the good stuff. By good stuff, I mean barrel-aged feta made with sheep’s milk, or a combination of sheep’s and goat’s milk. Feta made with cow’s milk is bleached, to mask the carotene that makes butter yellow, and lacks the natural piquancy and pepperiness of cheese made from the milk of hardier, hairier animals. Barrel-aged feta develops a stronger, spicier flavor than its modern, tin-aged counterpart, and can be kept in brine for up to a year. It’s worth remembering that not all good feta-style cheeses come from Greece—look out for Bulgarian and Romanian brands.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span class="calibre5">Saffron is inimitable. Turmeric, safflower and annatto are often used in its stead but can only ever hope to impart an approximation of its color, and maybe a little saffron-ish bitterness. Saffron combines the flavors of sea air, sweet dried grass and a hint of rusting metal—it’s the spice equivalent of Derek Jarman’s garden on the bleak rocky beach at Dungeness, defiantly strange and beautiful. This rarefied, and accordingly expensive, spice is most often paired with sweet ingredients, especially those pale enough on the eye and palate to show off its color and complex flavor—rice, bread, fish, potatoes, cauliflower and white beans. It also combines well with other bitter flavors, like almonds or citrus zest, and is especially harmonious with other bittersweet florals like rose.</span></span></p>

(Sweet tobacco, in fact, is the chief aroma I get opening a box of dried saffron stamens.) I like to call the following recipe my Saffron Induction Cake. Heat the oven to 350°F. Place 4 or 5 saffron threads in a heatproof dish and leave in the hot oven for a minute or two. Remove and crumble the threads into a tablespoon of warm milk sweetened with a pinch of sugar. Leave to infuse while you get on with the cake mixture. Cream 1 stick butter with ¾ cup superfine sugar. Your saffron milk should by now be the color of a desert sunrise. Add it to the butter-sugar mixture and beat well. Beat in 3 eggs and a scant ¾ cup ground almonds, adding them 1 egg and ¼ cup almonds at a time. Fold in 3 tbsp plain flour. Put the mixture in a greased and lined 7-in springform cake pan and bake at 350°F for 45 minutes. Leave to cool, then cut into 8 slices and eat one every day for a week, leaving one spare to induct a friend into the cult of which you will hopefully now be a devoted member.</span></span></p>

It’s best unchaperoned, although fennel, she concedes, is a good match in fish soups and stews. For an idea of just how good, put a single thread of saffron on your tongue; when the medicinal flavor passes, you should detect clear notes of licorice. You’ll also notice, next time you look in the mirror, that your teeth are the color of a leering Dickensian villain’s.</span></span></p>

These days, of course, it’s hard to find a Cornish saffron cake that uses real imported saffron, let alone the local stuff, and most bakers just dye their wares yellow: cakes with a fake tan. Which is a pity, as the astringent background flavor of saffron provides a beautiful contrast to the sweetness of the dried fruit. In the old days, bakers would leave the saffron stamens in the dough, which according to Elizabeth David suggests they understood the superior flavor of the whole stamen over powdered saffron, and that the stamens acted as a visual sign of quality.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span class="calibre5">This chapter covers anise seeds, licorice, fennel, tarragon, star anise and anise-flavored drinks like pastis. Anise seeds and fennel seeds share a primary flavor compound, anethol. They can be adequately substituted for one another, but what difference obtains between them is most noticeable when you nibble them straight from the jar—where anise seeds are sweet enough to please a licorice eater, fennel seeds are less sweet and greener, somehow more rustic. A better substitute for anise seeds is star anise, which is also anethol-dominated, and is the closest in flavor terms. A different, if chemically similar, compound, estragol, is primarily responsible for the anise flavor of tarragon and chervil (and is, incidentally, present in basil, too). Anise is a popular flavoring for alcoholic drinks: pastis, absinthe, ouzo, raki, arrack, sambuca and Galliano all share its licorice sweetness. It’s a very combinable flavor, equally successful in sweet or savory dishes, and gets along famously with seafood and sharp fruit.</span></span></p>

They’re found together in biscotti, those Italian delicacies that are somewhere between a sweet treat and hard labor. The following crumbly cookies, which wouldn’t seem out of place in the bakeries of Sicily either, deliver the pleasures of this combination without the jaw ache. Cream 6 tbsp soft butter with 2 oz superfine sugar. Add 1 egg yolk,  3 oz plain flour, 2 oz ground almonds, 1 tsp anise seeds and ½ tsp almond extract. Mix well, shape the dough into walnut-sized balls and bake at 325ºF for 25 minutes. When cool, sift over some confectioners’ sugar. Good with coffee but at their best with mint tea.</span></span></p>

If you can’t get fresh tarragon, freeze-dried is an acceptable second-best in cooked dishes, and will turn a dull chicken breast into as luxurious a meal as you can make in 15 minutes. Cut 4 skinless, boneless chicken breasts into bite-sized pieces and brown in a mixture of butter and peanut oil. Cover and leave over a fairly low heat until cooked through. Remove the chicken from the pan and keep hot. Soften a couple of finely chopped shallots in the pan, then deglaze it with ¾ cup dry white vermouth. Allow to reduce a little, then return the chicken to the pan with 1 tbsp chopped tarragon leaves (or 2 tbsp freeze-dried tarragon) and 1</span></span><span><span class="calibre22"><span class="underline">¼</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre5"> cups crème fraîche. Heat through and check the seasoning. Serve with white rice. If you have a little more time on your hands, massage roughly 2 tbsp soft butter into a whole oven-ready chicken, and scatter a little chopped tarragon over the surface and in the cavity before seasoning and roasting as normal. The Chinese might improve the flavor of chicken by placing a couple of star anise in the cavity before roasting it.</span></span></p>

Much has been written about the beautiful flavor of fennel pollen; the general consensus is that it’s like fennel, but more so, with a sweet, almost honeyed quality particularly suited to goat cheese. However, less rarefied sources of anise flavor work equally well.

If you can’t get your hands on fresh fronds of fennel, try poaching fish in a Chinese stock enriched with star anise. Put about 2 quarts of water, 1 cup Shaoxing wine (a fermented rice wine), ¾ cup soy sauce, ½ cup brown sugar, 6 star anise, 2 cinnamon sticks, a 2-in piece of fresh ginger, thickly sliced, and 5 garlic cloves in a large pan. Bring to the boil and simmer for an hour. Strain the stock through a sieve and either use straight away or freeze. Use to poach any white fish, or reduce to make a velvety sauce.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span class="calibre5">Russ Parsons, the </span></span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">Los Angeles Times</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre5"> food editor, notes that cucumber varieties are of more interest to the gardener than the cook: they all have the same distinctive green aroma and flavor that we recognize, logically enough, as cucumber-like. Even the lemon cucumber, which is yellow and lemon-sized, is named after its visual resemblance to the fruit rather than any discernible lemon flavor. Any differences that do exist between varieties generally boil down to levels of bitterness, and crispness on the teeth. The texture and refreshing cleanness of cucumber clearly lend themselves to garnishes and salads, but try pairing it with sour ingredients to knock the bitterness back a bit—goat cheese, yogurt and dill all make cucumber shine, as does vinegar. Pickled cucumbers, gherkins, cornichons and dill spears are indispensable with fatty pâtés, charcuterie and heavy sandwiches. Borage, which is also covered in this chapter, is a cucumber-flavored herb that can be used in salads, to flavor alcoholic cordials or as a garnish in drinks.</span></span></p>

Once it’s nice and hot, stuff the sandwich with the pickle and a thicket of fresh cilantro. Some people paint the inside of the bread with an oil, soy and fish sauce mixture before filling. Don’t stint on the pickle: as well as giving the sandwich its deeply satisfying crunch, it freshens up the heavy meat with its sweet-and-sour liveliness.

It tasted of dill, and as I was in Minneapolis I assumed this was a Scandinavian quirk, like saying “oh yah” and enjoying ice fishing. Soon I was mournfully searching under my coleslaw if lunch arrived without its pickle. The doubly fresh combination of dill and cucumber was like taking your appetite to the Laundromat. Just when consuming the second half of the sandwich, creeping up the constraining toothpick like rising dough, seemed a complete impossibility, you took a negligent crunch on your pickle and were ready for more. Pickles and gargantuan American portions are not accidental bedfellows. Neither are dill and cucumber. Dill seed is known for its digestive properties; it’s the main ingredient in gripe water. Cucumbers, conversely, are known for their indigestibility. And so—aside from the beautiful flavor combination—your digestion is held in perfect balance, at least until the pound of turkey, bacon, avocado and Monterey Jack hits your stomach and you’re gestating a belch that would reinflate the </span></span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">Hindenburg</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre5">. “Sour pickles” are fermented in brine, not vinegar, and “half sours,” fermented for a shorter time, are also available.</span></span></p>

It’s the sort of place you find all over France—neither rough-and-ready nor haute cuisine but the sort of mid-range establishment that in Britain often leaves something to be desired. There I was served a starter of cucumber salad with goat cheese. Nothing more than an arrangement of cucumber slices, translucently thin, topped with four slices of cheese and a garnish of flat-leaf parsley, but the cucumber’s floral perfume and alkaline nature set off the cheese’s lactic acid tang to perfection.</span></span></p>

Nonetheless, he should have tried cucumber with fish. Pickled, and in salsas, cucumber makes a crisp, cool counterpoint to fried, spicy or fatty dishes like goujons, smoked salmon pâté, fishcakes and fish kebabs. Chopped pickles, along with capers, provide the bite in tartare sauce. Some note that cooking cucumber intensifies its flavor while retaining a little of its soft crispness, and recommend cutting it into strips and stir-frying it with firm white fish.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span class="calibre5">Dill takes its name from the Norse word </span></span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">dilla</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre5">, meaning to lull, as the seeds are said to have a relaxing effect on the muscles. They’re anything but relaxing to the palate, however: dill seeds have a considerably stronger, sharper flavor than dill weed (i.e., the fresh herb). Dill weed (which is what these entries mean by “dill,” unless otherwise specified) strikes me as having a nervy flavor in keeping with its frayed fronds. It initially seems sweet, before a sour, clean taste takes over, to the benefit of rich fish, meat and creamy dishes. It also rubs along very well with other sour ingredients like lemon and vinegar. Not a flavor, in other words, for a Sunday afternoon slumped in front of a boxed set. Dill is complex, demanding and opinionated.

Odd that Big Macs are so popular, particularly among British teenagers, who aren’t known for their love of dill or dill pickles. (Admittedly, judging by the pavement outside my local branch, a lot of them jettison the pickles, but there’s still a heavy hit of dill flavor in the mysterious orange sauce.) My husband calls this Big Mac pie. Try it on your friends and see if they make the connection. Corned beef may strike you as an odd choice, but I’ve tried this using freshly ground beef and it doesn’t work anything like as well. Line an 8-in tart pan with shortcrust pastry. Slice and seed 2 tomatoes and lay the slices on the bottom. Mash a 12-oz can of corned beef with 4 tbsp dill relish, 1 tbsp dried dill and 1 tbsp yellow mustard. Spread the mixture over the tomatoes, cover with a pastry lid, brush with milk or beaten egg, then scatter with sesame seeds. Bake for 35–40 minutes at 375°F. Serve hot or cold.</span></span></p>

You can make Chinese dumplings in minutes if you can get your hands on the dumpling wrappers. Chinese supermarkets keep them in the cooler and they freeze very well. To make about 15, mix together ½ lb finely minced pork, 1 tbsp chopped dill, a crushed garlic clove, 1 tbsp soy sauce, 1 tbsp Shaoxing wine, a shake of sesame oil and a little salt.

<p><span><span class="calibre5">Parsley’s fresh, green, woody notes are described as “generic” by Harold McGee, which is, according to him, why the herb complements so many foods. It is at its best with briny ingredients, especially ham and all types of fish, to which it brings a welcome coolness, and a bitterness that offsets the salt-sweetness in meat. Its generic herbal flavor also makes it great for mixing with other herbs. The flat-leaf variety usually has a stronger flavor and leaves that are more tender than those of curly parsley.</span></span></p>

It was gastronomic junk mail: something you were wearily accustomed to throwing away. But as a partner for white fish it’s indispensable. The saltiness of the fish is offset by the herb’s leafy freshness. For a parsley sauce to serve with firm white fish such as cod or haddock, add a generous amount of chopped parsley to a béchamel sauce and season with lemon zest and a little lemon juice. Or, for a lighter, faster variation, dip your fish fillets in seasoned flour, cook in olive oil and add a little white wine and fish stock (or water). Allow to reduce a little and, when the fish is cooked through, scatter with chopped parsley. See also Lemon &amp; Parsley, <a href="#dummy_split_020.html#filepos1404731">*</a>.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span class="calibre5">In common with its lookalike, flat-leaf parsley, cilantro is characterized by fresh, green and woody notes. But in place of parsley’s cold-rain flavor, cilantro is more redolent of the monsoon, with hints of warm earthiness and fruity citrus peel. It has a bittersweet taste, and is often used as a garnish, partly because its flavor isn’t heat-stable and therefore needs to be added at the end of cooking, and partly because it has so many useful tempering qualities. Cilantro calms saltiness, deodorizes fishiness, cuts fattiness and lends a cooling note to hot, spicy food.</span></span></p>

They have harmonious, grassy flavors in common, but the freshness of cilantro cuts through avocado’s fattiness, especially in the spin taken on the pairing by Ferran Adrià at El Bulli, where the avocado is deep-fried in tempura batter. Cooked avocado is not to everyone’s taste—it’s thought that tannins in the flesh become increasingly bitter when cooked—but I’ve not been able to detect anything unpleasant in gratinéed avocado, which used to be popular in trattorias, or in my own experiments with tempura. Whether or not you can handle the double fat-whammy of deep-fried avocado, even with the mediation of cilantro, is another matter.</span></span></p>

With the motor running, drizzle ½ cup lukewarm milk or water through the tube and your mixture will become a dough. Remove and knead for 5 minutes. Cover with a damp cloth and leave to rest for 20 minutes. Divide the dough into 4 and roll each piece into a rectangle roughly 8 x 6 in. Mentally dividing each in half lengthwise, scatter the right-hand side with some cilantro and flaked coconut, then fold the left side over and gently roll out until it’s as thin as it will go. Set the grill to high and line the grill pan with greased foil. Grill your flatbreads just below the heat source for 90 seconds, then turn and grill on the other side for about 60 seconds, by which time they should have developed some golden patches.

Cilantro has a tendency to lose its flavor when cooked but the sheer amount used in this recipe, plus the inclusion of the stalks, ensures its leafy freshness survives, mingling with the spinach, the lamb juices and yogurt to make a curry that’s very luscious in the mouth but not in the least bit rich or cloying. In an ovenproof pot, fry a chopped large onion in a little butter and oil until soft. Add a crushed garlic clove, 1 tsp salt, a thumb of fresh ginger, finely chopped, 1 tbsp ground coriander, ½ tsp turmeric and chopped fresh chili to taste. Stir, and cook for a few minutes, then add 2 lb diced lamb. Brown the meat and stir in 1 package (defrosted) frozen whole-leaf spinach and most of a good bunch of cilantro—leaves roughly chopped, stems quite finely chopped. Gradually add 1¼ cups yogurt. Cover, transfer to the oven and cook at 325°F for 2 hours. Before serving, stir in the cilantro you’ve held back, to restore some of the top notes lost in the cooking.

Lime, I thought, is sweet. Bear in mind I was brought up on Rose’s lime cordial and its matching alien-plasma marmalade: sweet and then some. The more I ate Vietnamese and Thai food, however, the more lime began to turn up in savory dishes, most often in partnership with cilantro. It wasn’t long before I was ordering dishes simply because they came with lime and cilantro, which is a bit like buying a song because you like the backing vocals, and no worse a habit for that.

Harold McGee writes that the main component of cilantro’s aroma is a fatty aldehyde called decenal, which is also responsible for the waxy note in orange peel. Decenal is highly unstable, so cilantro quickly loses its characteristic aroma when heated, and is mostly used uncooked, as a garnish. Try a salad of orange slices, sweet onion and radish, strewn with torn cilantro. Some Thai spice pastes include cilantro root, which contains no decenal, instead contributing woody, green notes not dissimilar to parsley. Cilantro is often used to pep up orange, mandarin and other citrus notes in manufactured flavorings. Cilantro’s oranginess is markedly more apparent in its fruit—see Orange &amp; Coriander Seed, <a href="#dummy_split_020.html#filepos1348734">*</a>.</span></span></p>

Cilantro was once the herb of choice in South America, Asia and the Caribbean, while parsley held sway in Europe and North America. Slowly and surely cilantro is doing for parsley what the gray squirrel did for the red. It’s the most consumed herb in the world. But, if it can’t beat cilantro, parsley can join it. It shares a green grassiness with cilantro and so can be used to dilute it in a dish without skimping on the quantities of herb. And you needn’t feel too sorry for parsley in any case. It’ll always have ham.</span></span></p>

Delicate avocado goes well with other subtly flavored ingredients, such as mozzarella and crustaceans; the latter love the light anise note in avocado flesh. Often buried under stronger flavors, like lime and garlic, the flavor of avocado arguably runs second to its lovely, unctuous texture, and the cooling, fatty quality it brings to sandwiches, salads and salsas. Avocado oil is even more delicately flavored than the flesh, and lacks the grassy note, for which you’d be advised to seek out an olive oil instead.</span></span></p>

Avocado takes care of the texture. The aim of the rawist is to eat as much of their food uncooked as possible. If this sounds quite hardcore, rawism’s a cakewalk compared to being an instincto. Instinctos eat only one, raw ingredient per sitting, selected according to what smells right. This might be fruit, vegetable, egg, fish, badger or grub, as long as it’s uncooked, unseasoned and neither juiced nor ground. The method is straightforward: the instincto sniffs at a range of foods until they find one that smells instinctively right (instinctos are easy to spot at the Pizza Hut salad bar). In time they reach a state of such instinctive receptiveness that they only have to pass, say, a freshly road-killed rabbit to stop and with lizard-like relish snatch it from its final resting place in the hedge. Then they feast on it until they can eat no more—or “reach their stop” (in this regard they’re less easy to spot at the Pizza Hut salad bar). A typical instincto meal might thus consist of 52 egg yolks at a single sitting, or 210 passion fruit in a day.</span></span></p>

The field pea, most commonly eaten dried in the form of split green peas, is the garden pea’s country cousin. It’s less fresh tasting, in part because of the farinaceous texture of its flesh, which swells and bursts from the skin when cooked. Marrowfat peas are also a type of field pea.

Defrost 1 lb frozen peas and pat them dry, then roughly process them with 1 egg, 1 tbsp olive oil, 4 tbsp plain flour and some seasoning. Using a pair of dessert spoons, shape the pea mixture into 12–15 quenelles. Shallow-fry them in vegetable oil for a few minutes, turning them twice so they cook on all 3 sides. Serve 3 to a plate with a dollop of sauce made from finely chopped fresh tarragon leaves stirred into seasoned crème fraîche.

The combination of asparagus and pea might sound light but it’s remarkably flavorful, and very good in risottos or egg-based dishes. The “asparagus pea,” incidentally, is claimed by some to re-create the delicious subtleties of asparagus. Sadly, it doesn’t.</span></span></p>

That is excellent, but by no means the only way to taste this vegetable in perfection; an Old Digger may not be supposed to know much about cooking, but in fact no place lies so close to the kitchen as the kitchen-garden, and it must be a dull digger who does not know something of what the cook does with his ‘truck’. So I will tell you that the neatest little dishes that any cook ever sends to the table are very small joints of lamb or veal, or perhaps a pair of spring chickens, stewed in a close pot or stew pan very gently, over a slow fire, for two or three hours, till quite done, with peas—butter, pepper, and salt being added, of course. The juices of the meat penetrate the peas, and the flavor of the peas is given to the whole dish, so that I doubt that there was more savory dishes among the flesh-pots of Egypt, than one of these stews.”</span></span></p>

In a separate pan make a sauce with 1 tbsp butter, 1 tbsp plain flour and ½ cup meat stock and stir into the vegetables. Place this mixture in a heatproof dish in layers, sprinkling grated cheese (Parmesan or pecorino) between them, and cover with a shortcrust pastry lid. Brush with a beaten egg yolk and bake at 425°F for 10 minutes, then 350°F for 20 minutes or until the crust has browned. If you fancy something lighter than pie, another classic Italian recipe is to stew chopped artichoke hearts with fava beans, sliced onion and pancetta for about 15 minutes, then add peas and cook for an additional 10–15 minutes, keeping the mixture moist with a few tablespoons of white wine and/or water as necessary.</span></span></p>

Where the garden pea is sweet, with a grassy-fresh flavor attributable to the compound that gives green peppers their characteristic aroma, field peas are more akin to another member of the legume family, the lentil. They have a meatier flavor, and are most commonly cooked with ham or bacon, but rosemary’s woody eucalyptus notes suit them too. The following is a recipe for soup, but can be cooked with less water to make a side dish for lamb or pork. Soften a chopped onion in olive oil, then add ½ lb dried green split peas, a sprig of rosemary and about 6 cups of stock. Bring to the boil, turn down the heat and simmer for 1–1½ hours, until the peas are soft, seasoning toward the end of the cooking if necessary. Add boiling water if the pan is running dry. You can reduce the cooking time by pre-soaking the peas for a few hours. You might alternatively use yellow split peas, but note that they tend to be milder and sweeter than the green ones and have a less earthy taste.</span></span></p>

The natural sweetness of pea emphasizes the savoriness of the fish, whether in a humble Styrofoam cup of mushy peas with fish and chips or the turbot served with scallops, pork belly and pea purée at Michael Caines’s Michelin-starred Gidleigh Park. And as pea loves salty ingredients, it pairs exceptionally well with </span></span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">bacalao</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre5">, or salt cod.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span class="calibre5">Green peppers are immature red peppers. Green and red differ substantially in flavor but for the purposes of concision share one chapter here. Yellow and orange have more in common with the flavor of red than with green. As you might imagine from an unripe fruit, green peppers are more bitter and have a fresher, grassier flavor than the heat-ripened red, which is sweeter and fruitier. They can sometimes, but not always, be substituted for one another, although you wouldn’t stuff a bitter olive with green pepper, and red peppers don’t have quite the freshening quality that makes green so good in a stir-fry.</span></span></p>

Even good cooks produce dog chews of cindered meat and trays of chicken à la salmonella. In my experience, only one outdoor-cooked meal ever came within a smoke wisp of the campfire meatfeasts that made my stomach rumble during cowboy films, and it was in the middle of the New Forest in the 1970s. It was August, baking hot; I must have been eight or nine. We were with my parents’ best friends—a chef, originally from Italy, and his wife. Having found a shady spot by a stream, Piero built a fire while my father made a rope swing. I busied myself making star-shapes on the swing until a whiff of searing meat lured me off the rope, over to where the grown-ups were holding sticks—real sticks from the forest floor!—threaded with beef and green peppers over the fire. It tasted like nothing I’ve ever eaten since. Maybe because the beef was aged rump steak, cut into chunks large enough to stay tender and juicy on the inside while crisp, salty and charred on the outside. Maybe because the peppers were quartered like cups so they caught and held the juices of the meat. And maybe because real and highly illegal wood fires will always lend more flavor to food than barbecue briquettes.</span></span></p>

They might have a point—think how well juniper goes with game—but the stuffed olive definitely pips it when it comes to sparing drinkers the inconvenience of hacking up seeds like a parrot while sitting at the bar trying to radiate seductiveness or discourse on American foreign policy. And besides, the red bull’s-eye, pierced through the middle with the toothpick, serves as a handy visual metaphor for the effect a properly made martini has on the brain.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span class="calibre5">The heat of chili can make it difficult to appreciate its various flavor characteristics. As with their close relatives, bell peppers, green chilies are unripe and have a fresh green-bean/pea flavor. Red chilies are sweeter and less easy to characterize. Dried chilies are sweeter still, and tend to the same rich, fruity, sometimes smoky, leathery flavors as sun-dried tomatoes and olives. Chili fans might like to familiarize themselves with the flavors and heat intensities of a range of cultivars, and with chili products such as oils, sauces, vodkas and pastes.</span></span></p>

It’s made with pulverized almonds (and/or hazelnuts), tomato, garlic and a dried sweet chili pepper from which the sauce takes its name, otherwise known as the nora. Noras are always dried, are red-brown in color and have a smoky flavor. They’re one of the dried red peppers that are ground to make Spain’s ubiquitous pimentón, or Spanish paprika. If you can’t find noras, try anchos.

It’s a less unfamiliar idea than it might seem at first, operating on the same principles as salt and pepper but turned up a few notches. Sea salt is rarely used as a seasoning in Thailand—it’s considered a rather crude ingredient. Peppercorns, although still used in Thai sauces and pastes, lost ground to chili peppers as the major contributor of heat when the latter arrived from the New World in the sixteenth century.</span></span></p>

This recipe is quick and easy enough to rustle up warm for breakfast. Whisk 2 eggs in a large bowl, then add 1 2/3 cups plain yogurt and 4 tbsp melted butter and whisk again. Sift together ½ cup plain flour, 2 tsp salt and 1 tsp bicarbonate of soda, gradually stirring it all into the egg mixture. Then add 1¾ cups fine cornmeal and fold in 4 crumbled, well-cooked bacon slices and 1 tsp dried chili flakes. These will lend some welcome smokiness, as well as a flicker of heat, but you could also use an equivalent amount of finely chopped fresh green jalapeños. Grease a muffin tray (use the fat from frying the bacon), fill to about halfway with the mixture and bake at 400°F for about 20 minutes, until golden and risen. Alternatively, pour the whole lot into a 9-in square pan and cook for 25–30 minutes before cutting into squares. Whatever the shape, it’s excellent spread with cold cream cheese and a piquant chili jelly.</span></span></p>

Chili heat is measured on the Scoville scale, with habanero and Scotch bonnet chilies scoring 80,000–150,000 and jalapeños 2,500–8,000. Bell peppers score a big fat zero. But remove the seeds and ribs from a green jalapeño and, with its heat reduced, a nibble will reveal a very similar flavor to its mild-mannered relative. They share a dominant flavor compound, 2-methoxy-3-isobutylpyrazine, which is also present in Cabernet Sauvignon and Sauvignon Blanc wines. Similarly, red chilies taste like red peppers, although unlike green they lack a shared single character-impact compound (i.e., a compound that can summon up an ingredient in one sniff). Nonetheless, green or red, big or small, all are highly combinable. Try an Indian chili-laced potato mixture stuffed into green peppers: mix roughly mashed potato with onion fried with an Indian spice blend and chili, stuff into halved, seeded peppers, put a little knob of butter on each and bake until the peppers are cooked through—about 30–40 minutes at 350ºF. You can speed up the process by blanching the peppers first.</span></span></p>

There’s a lot to be said for trying out the full range of pimentón varieties to understand quite how different one is from the other, and (note to self) not just because they come in such pretty cans. Paprika from Hungary is similarly prepared with dried red chilies and is available in a similar range of styles, but is said to be fruitier than pimentón.

<p><span><span class="calibre5">Sweet basil is the warmest, most fragrant, beautiful, fresh and irritatingly likeable of herbs. It has strong notes of spice—clove, cinnamon, anise and tarragon—combined with a minty grassiness that’s particularly noticeable when it is pulverized in quantity to make pesto. Basil comes in many “flavor variants,” such as lemon, lime, cinnamon and the licorice-flavored Thai basil, all of which share a rich spiciness and an enlivening freshness. Dried basil is no substitute for fresh, but it’s not to be sniffed at. Sure, with drying, the beautiful, perfumed top note disappears, but carefully dried basil develops a spicy, licorice-like, mint character that works well in fish stews or baked lamb dishes.</span></span></p>

Identifiable by its purple stem, Thai basil has a licorice flavor with a hint of cinnamon. Unless you live near a Thai or Chinese supermarket, it’s probably easier to grow your own than find it to buy, and well worth it if you cook a lot of Thai curries or stir-fries.</span></span></p>

I’ve heard of Italian housewives putting a pinch of ground cloves in their pesto if the basil isn’t pulling its weight. The flavor of holy basil, used in Thai cooking, is dominated by eugenol and, when fresh, shares some of clove’s anesthetic effect on the mouth. Which is maybe why the herb is often paired with chili in stir-fries such as </span></span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">bai kaprow</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre5">: the basil takes the edge off the chili’s heat. Pound 3 cloves of garlic, fresh red chili to taste and a little salt into a paste. Heat 2 tbsp peanut oil over a high heat and cook the paste for 30 seconds. Add 2 minced or thinly sliced chicken breasts and stir-fry until cooked through. Pour in a sauce mix of 3 tbsp water, 2 tbsp soy sauce, 1 tsp sugar, ¼ tsp white pepper and a handful of holy basil leaves. Serve with plain rice. Season to taste with the sauce in Lime &amp; Anchovy, <a href="#dummy_split_020.html#filepos1371976">*</a>.</span></span></p>

Strewing standard sweet basil over a creamy Thai curry works wonders, not just on the flavor but also by giving it the floating-market prettiness that makes Thai soups so appetizing to the eye. Even better, if you can get it, Thai basil has a similar flavor to its sweet relative, but with stronger aniseed notes.</span></span></p>

Pair it with a lusty goat cheese—preferably something piquant, well chilled, and soft enough to be spread on these pesto scones. Place 2½ cups plain flour in a food processor with a pinch of salt and 1 tbsp baking powder and pulse to mix. Add 6 tbsp diced cold butter and resume pulsing until the mixture has the texture of breadcrumbs. Mix 4 tbsp pesto with ½ cup cold milk and add through the feed tube with the machine running. Mix until you have a dough, adding a little more milk or flour respectively if it’s too dry or too wet. Remove the dough, knead briefly on a floured surface until smooth, and roll out to ½ in thick. Cut out rounds with a 2½-in biscuit cutter, place on a greased baking sheet and bake at 425°F for 12–15 minutes.</span></span></p>

If that’s too much trouble on a hot summer’s day, in less than ten minutes you could chop and pile them onto toasted rustic bread for bruschetta, or made a salad with mozzarella, or a panzanella salad with yesterday’s bread. Or try tossing chopped tomato and torn-up basil leaves through just-cooked angel hair pasta with a little olive oil and seasoning; so rewarding for such little effort.

Pit 1 lb sour (e.g., morello) cherries. Put the stones in a freezer bag and bash with a rolling pin until some of them are cracked. Empty into a pan with 2 cups wine (Riesling, Bordeaux and fruity rosés are all commonly used in this type of soup), a 3-in cinnamon stick, ¼ cup sugar, a strip of lemon zest, the juice of ½ lemon and a pinch of salt. Bring these to a simmer, cover and cook for 15 minutes. Strain the mixture into a clean pan over a medium heat. Hold back a few tablespoons and mix them with 1 tsp cornstarch to make a paste. Add this to the warming, boozy cherry juice and stir until it thickens a little. Add the cherries and simmer for about 10 minutes, until soft. Leave to cool a little, then stir in 2/3 cup sour cream and liquefy in a blender. Serve chilled as an appetizer or a dessert, perhaps using more sugar in the latter case. If you can only find sweet cherries, use just 1–2 tbsp sugar to begin with, add a little more lemon juice, then adjust to taste accordingly.</span></span></p>

In every airport and mall in the United States, the Cinnabon baker slides a fresh tray of rolls out of the oven every 30 minutes and gives them a rich cream-cheese frosting. Cinnabon rolls are basically butch Danish pastries. They’re deeper, stickier and deliver a far stronger cinnamon hit—maybe because in the U.S. (in common with China, Vietnam and Indonesia) cinnamon flavor comes from the cinnamon-like cassia plant, </span></span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">Cinnamomum aromaticum</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre5">. Cassia grows in China and Indonesia and is harder and darker than the true cinnamon from Sri Lanka that we get in the UK. It’s also stronger, hotter, simpler and generally more intense in the mouth compared to true cinnamon’s sweeter, more complex flavor. Basically cassia’s the hard stuff, which may explain why America is addicted.</span></span></p>

Mace, nutmeg’s outer coating, is composed of the same flavor compounds but in different proportions, and contains slighter greater quantities of essential oil. They can be used interchangeably, but always opt for fresh rather than the pre-ground form of either.

Macaroni and cheese is a case in point. The flavor of nutmeg is a complex mixture of pine, flower, citrus and warm peppery notes from a compound called myristicin, which is said to give nutmeg its hallucinogenic qualities. When nutmeg is added to bland foods, like cheesy pasta, custards and potato, the complexity is especially notable—even more so if you add enough to begin hallucinating about it.</span></span></p>

To make </span></span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">spaghetti corfiote</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre5">, chop ½ small onion and soften it in 3 tbsp butter or lard. Add 1 lb minced lamb and cook until well browned. Stir in 1 cup tomato passata, 1 cup white wine, 1 cup water, 2 tbsp chopped parsley, ¼ nutmeg, freshly grated, and a good pinch of sugar. Season, bring to the boil, and cook gently for about 1 hour, stirring intermittently, until most of the liquid has been absorbed. Add an extra grating of nutmeg, check the seasoning and serve on pasta. The taverna served this on bucatini, a long, thin pasta similar to spaghetti but hollow, like a tiny water main. Note that some moussaka recipes substitute cinnamon for nutmeg, in a similar vein to the Greek dish </span></span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">pastitsio</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre5">—see Beef &amp; Cinnamon, <a href="#dummy_split_008.html#filepos178904">*</a>.</span></span></p>

It’s the seasoning that’s used for oyster loaves, which are said to have originated in Massachusetts in the late eighteenth century. Cut lids from the tops of some crusty bread rolls, scoop out their soft, bready center and paint the cavity with melted butter. Put the hollowed rolls and lids in a 400°F oven for no more than 10 minutes while you cook the filling. Take enough oysters to fill the rolls and stew them along with their liquor, and the torn-up excavated bread, in some butter for 5 minutes. Add a little cream and a grating of nutmeg and cook for another minute. Fill the hot rolls with the oyster mixture, replace their lids and serve.</span></span></p>

Aside from their ivory flesh, parsnip and banana share a sweet spiciness. Try a piece of roasted parsnip, close your eyes and think of banana—more convincing than carrots posing as apricots, another wartime substitution. Add a little ground cloves and rum to them and it’s even more of a match. Now that bananas are no longer threatened by U-boats, a mock parsnip made of banana might lend a Caribbean lilt to your Sunday roast, but better to pair them in a moist cake—parsnips were once as popular a cake ingredient as carrots are now.</span></span></p>

On a less homey note, Charlie Trotter makes a terrine of beef cheek, salsify and endive with a parsnip purée. And as parsnip has a passion for salty flavors, I pair slices of the Italian air-dried salted beef, bresaola, with slices of parsnip and Parmesan bread made to Delia Smith’s recipe.</span></span></p>

Try them together in a winter pea soup. The parsnip acts as a thickener and also brings a lightly spicy flavor; it’s like a sunny winter’s day. Peel and chop 3 parsnips, then cook in olive oil with a sliced onion until softened. Add 3 cups vegetable or chicken stock, bring to the boil and simmer for 10 minutes. Then add about 1 lb frozen peas and season. Bring back to the boil, simmer for 5 minutes, then leave to cool a little. Liquefy, reheat and serve.</span></span></p>

Parsnips are not just excellent for fattening the herd: they’re known to have an enriching effect on the flavor of pig meat, and are often fed to prosciutto pigs. Reciprocally enough, in the nineteenth century the flavor of parsnips was often improved by boiling them with salt pork, then mashing and frying them in butter—which sounds great, but would probably also improve the flavor of cotton balls.</span></span></p>

Salsify, another pale root, is sometimes called the oyster plant, as it’s said to taste like oysters, although I’d say a delicate, more savory parsnip is probably closer. Scorzonera, sometimes known as black salsify, looks and tastes similar to regular salsify but has a dark skin, as its name suggests.</span></span></p>

This will draw out some of the water and prevent the coleslaw from turning soupy. It also gives the dish a more complex, savory quality in place of the sweet, innocent fruitiness.</span></span></p>

Homegrown carrots, on the other hand, tugged from the ground when they’re long, thin and pointed, are perfect for this combination. Toss them, washed but unpeeled, in olive oil and sprinkle with cumin before roasting. This will intensify both their earthiness and their sweetness, coaxing the sugars to the surface, where they caramelize and mingle deliciously with the spice.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span class="calibre5">Butternut squash and pumpkins share a chapter as they have similar flavor affinities and are often used interchangeably. Bear in mind, nonetheless, that butternut squash is naturally sweeter and will require less sugar in sweet recipes. There’s also a difference in texture: the dense flesh of butternut squash is fine-grained and silky, whereas pumpkin can be rather fibrous. The pronounced sweetness of butternut squash works well with salty ingredients; cut through with something spikily sour; or, in combination with the density of its flesh, as a background for potent herbs such as rosemary and sage.</span></span></p>

It fainted instantaneously into the soup, leaving a trace of cinnamon sweetness and the gentlest lick of heat. Back in London a week later, trying to re-create the experience in my own kitchen, I left the soup chilling in the fridge as I riffled through eBay for a cotton candy machine. I came to my senses. Who needs another large device, solely in order to make a soup taste </span></span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">slightly</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre5"> better, when you already have to stack tea towels on top of sieves on top of an ice-cream machine?

Shape into cakes about 2 in in diameter and ½ in deep, then leave to firm up in the fridge for about 30 minutes before deep-frying in vegetable oil.

Cutting a vent in chestnuts is essential to stop them exploding in the oven. You really needn’t bother with sprouts: it’ll only risk overcooking them. And you’ll need all your energy to peel the chestnuts, and suppress the yodel of agony when a shard of superheated shell insinuates itself behind your thumbnail. If you have gone to the trouble of gathering them yourself, don’t squander it by eating them too soon—sweet chestnuts need a few days to dry out, giving the starch a chance to convert to sugar, thereby intensifying the flavor. The sprout and chestnut pairing is delicious, of course, but why not try braising chestnuts with apple and red cabbage, or, if your hands have recovered, stuff a cabbage, adapting the recipe in Cabbage &amp; Pork on <a href="#dummy_split_012.html#filepos531030">*</a>, using chestnut and bacon in place of the pork and beef.</span></span></p>

Here its soft pastiness makes an admirable ground on which more pungent flavours may display themselves, a more attractive background than the (nearly) all conquering potato.” Bunyard was most likely thinking of how chestnuts pair with fattier, boldly flavored game birds such as goose or duck, although the pairing is just as common in stuffings for chicken and turkey.</span></span></p>

Peel roasted chestnuts, removing the thin inner skin too. Soften them in butter, white wine and a little stock, then purée. Mix the cooking juices from the sausages into the chestnut mixture before serving. Chestnuts have an unusually high carbohydrate content for a nut, which accounts for their traditional use as a potato substitute; it also allows them to be ground into flour for baking. Its farinaceous quality earned the sweet chestnut the nickname “bread tree” in Corsica. The chestnut is also used to brew Pietra, Corsica’s first native beer, which has a roasted, smoky quality.</span></span></p>

Through more prosperous times, it has accrued a variety of rosemary, pine nuts, dried fruit, walnuts and candied peel. Chestnut flour has a curious aroma, somewhere between cocoa and silage, which makes for a rustic flavor experience. And I mean really rustic: it tastes like the floor of a shepherd’s refuge. Not to everyone’s tastes, then, but if you want to try it for yourself, mix 2 cups sifted chestnut flour and a pinch of salt to a smooth batter with 1½ cups water. Stir in some finely snipped rosemary leaves and pour into a buttered 9-in flan tin—it’s a shallow cake. Scatter with pine nuts, brush generously with olive oil and bake at 375ºF for 30–45 minutes, until the top is dark brown and fretted with cracks like old varnish. You’ll notice the recipe contains no raising agent, and pretty much the only sweetness comes from what’s naturally present in the chestnuts, so if you have guests you might want to recalibrate any expectations the word “cake” may arouse.</span></span></p>

They’re notoriously hard shelled, and have to be whacked with a hammer, driven over by a station wagon or taken to the local shelling depot.

Hazelnuts grown in the Piedmont region of Italy are particularly renowned for their quality. Less glorious specimens can taste woody, with a metallic streak, rather like pencil shavings. Like all nuts, hazelnuts become more flavorful when heated: research has shown that the key hazelnut flavor compound increases tenfold when the nuts are roasted. The bittersweet richness of hazelnuts is also good ground into a coating for delicate, buttery seafoods or as the basis for a luxurious sauce. Hazelnut oil is useful for baking and is a treat in dressings. Frangelico and </span></span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">crème de noisette</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre5"> are hazelnut-flavored liqueurs.

A ciabatta roll was excavated from the bottom of the freezer, defrosted in the toaster, given a drizzle of hazelnut oil, sprinkled with a few almonds and sultanas picked from my husband’s muesli, squashed together and eaten while still warm. It tasted amazing, somewhere between fruitcake and pain au chocolat, without the sickliness of either. Happily the bread’s air holes turned out to be perfect pockets for the fruit and nuts, deepening its similarity to fruitcake.</span></span></p>

If you find the hazelnut flavor too strong, dilute it with sunflower oil, which has a hint of hazelnut flavor itself. Ground hazelnuts can be used to flavor your baking too—you’ll need to substitute them for a third to a quarter of the flour called for in cake recipes. By all means grind them yourself in a food processor, but roast them first to activate all the flavor compounds, then remove the bitter skins—unless you’re making a coarser cake, in which case leaving the skins on can be rather good.</span></span></p>

<div class="calibre21">
 
</div>
<p><span><span class="calibre5">There are two distinct kinds of almond flavor, bitter and sweet. Bitter almond is the pronounced marzipan flavor that is found in almond extract, almond essence and Amaretto. The extract is derived from bitter almond kernels and from other stone fruits, such as apricot and peach; it must be treated to remove its cyanide content before it is suitable for human consumption. The primary compound responsible for bitter almond flavor is benzaldehyde, which was first synthesized in 1870 and is the second most used flavoring in the world. Aside from bitter almonds, it is also naturally found in a number of foods, including the prince mushroom and the cinnamon relative, cassia. Bitter almond goes particularly well with fellow members of the rose family—stone fruits, berries, apples, pears and rose itself. It’s used to boost the flavor of other nuts; you may detect a hint of bitter almond in some dyed green pistachio ice creams. The sweet almond is the world’s most popular nut. It has hints of bitter almond flavor but is mild, milky and slightly grassy when raw, and richer when roasted, with a slight toffee-popcorn flavor. Sweet almond’s soft, rounded flavor makes it highly compatible. Almond milk and almond butter are available from health-food shops.</span></span></p>

Farther north, Lancaster lemon tart is a variation on Bakewell tart (see Raspberry &amp; Almond, <a href="#dummy_split_022.html#filepos1537712">*</a>) that omits jam in favor of a thick spread of lemon curd under the cooked almond and egg mixture. In Italy, </span></span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">torta della nonna</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre5"> is usually made with lemons and pine nuts, or occasionally almonds—perhaps when </span></span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">la nonna</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre5"> has squandered her pension on sweet wine.

You could try using the whole fruit (zest, juice, pith) as described in Orange &amp; Almond on <a href="#dummy_split_020.html#filepos1339669">*</a>, increasing the amount of sugar a little to compensate for the lemon’s extra sourness, but expect quite a mouth-drying result.

<p><span><span class="calibre5">In common with the apple, a fellow member of the </span></span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">Rosaceae</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre5"> family, cherries come in sweet and sour form, with something of a gray area in between. And like apples, they have a predominantly fresh, green, fruity character and an almond-scented seed, although almond flavor is far more strongly present in cherry stones than in apple seeds—so much so, in fact, that the bitter-almond compound, benzaldehyde, forms the basis of synthesized cherry flavoring. In real cherries, almond flavor is most easily detectable when the fruit is cooked with the stones in. Cherries also have floral and spicy notes, plus a tannic quality that is particularly noticeable in the dried form of the fruit. Cherries are especially lovely with spices such as vanilla and cinnamon, and are paired with them to make cherry liqueurs. Kirsch and maraschino are clear, distilled spirits with a clean cherry flavor that goes very well in fruit salads or with flambéed fruit.</span></span></p>

Benzaldehyde is the second most popular flavor molecule in the U.S. flavor-and-fragrance industry, after vanillin, and is used to synthesize both almond and cherry flavors. Sip a cherry cola and think of Amaretto and you’ll taste the proximity. It’s the cherry stone that tastes most like almond, not the flesh. Unless it’s a maraschino cherry. Brined while unripe and green, maraschino cherries were originally steeped in a liqueur made from the juice, stones and leaves of cherry, which gave them a lovely, drunken marzipan flavor. These days most maraschinos are steeped in sugar syrup and given an almond flavoring, which doesn’t taste half as nice—so if you want the best garnish for your Manhattan you’ll have to steep your own, or seek out an artisan producer. Make a Manhattan by stirring aboutr 2¾ tbsp good rye or bourbon, 2 tbsp sweet vermouth and a dash of angostura bitters with ice and then straining over a maraschino cherry.</span></span></p>

Keep your eye out for them in high summer and, if you love long walks punctuated by picnics but can’t bear to lug around a hamper or a cooler, this less-is-more lunch is ideal. Wrap fresh cherries and a few rounds of goat cheese in a paper bag with only as many slices of crumbly, nutty bread as you plan to eat, then head off to your picnic spot. I like to eat some of the cheese piled on the bread first and then relish the rest of it with the cherries, ending the meal with the remaining cherries on their own. Edward Bunyard writes that to enjoy cherries at their best you should walk through an orchard just after they’ve been harvested and pick the ripe remainders, so maybe you should plan your route accordingly.</span></span></p>

Created by Escoffier for Queen Victoria’s Golden Jubilee in 1887, the dish originally consisted of sweet cherries cooked in a thick, sugary sauce to which kirsch or brandy was added before being set alight. In later versions, Escoffier ladled the cherries over vanilla ice cream, which is almost certainly how you’d be served it today. Cooks who value their eyebrows might settle for cherry clafoutis, a French dessert of cherries cooked in a sweet batter, sometimes flavored with almond, although vanilla is more common. The cherries are left unpitted, as the stones bring a balancing bitterness to the dish. Put 1 lb sweet cherries in a buttered 9-in round ovenproof dish. Split a vanilla pod and scrape the seeds out into a saucepan containing 1 cup milk. Throw in the pod while you’re at it, then scald the milk and set aside to cool. Whisk 2 eggs, 1 egg yolk and 2/3 cup superfine sugar until well combined. Add 6 tbsp melted butter  and whisk some more. Sift in 1/3 cup plain flour and whisk until smooth. Remove the vanilla pod and whisk the milk into the batter. Pour this over the cherries and bake for about 30 minutes at 400ºF, until set and golden on top.</span></span></p>

Mark Twain called the watermelon “chief of this world’s luxuries,” and if you get your hands on a ripe one you may be inclined to agree. Look for a watermelon that’s as heavy as a medicine ball and sings a low B-flat when you thump it. As a rule, the seeded varieties taste better than the seedless ones. Watermelon juice is the color of rubies and has a lovely sweet flavor with a vegetable undertone, a little like carrot juice. The compatibility of watermelon flesh with other ingredients is limited by its tendency to waterlog them, but herbal and sour flavors make fine pairings.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span class="calibre5">Impossible to write about grapes without writing about wine; the sheer variety of wine grapes, and of the flavors coaxed from them by vinification, is simply astounding. Regrettably, the same can’t be said for the sorts of table grape available in shops. Broadly speaking, the difference between table and wine grapes is that the former are bred to be thin-skinned and seedless, and thus easy to eat. The skin of a grape is where much of its flavor resides, and it also gives red and rosé wines their color. The table/wine divide is not absolute, however: some varieties fulfill both functions. Muscat wine, for example, has the unusual quality of tasting like the grapes it was made from (consider how often wine tastes of apples, grapefruit, gooseberries, apricots, melon and black currants, and how rarely of grapes). With their honeyed, floral quality and notes of rose and coriander seed, muscat grapes are also delicious plucked off the bunch. Other white table grapes have similar flavors, while red grapes can have hints of strawberry or black currant, at least when given time to develop on the vine. This, sadly, is rare, and all too often we’re saddled with slightly unripe, seedless varieties whose flavor could at best be described as generically fruity. The unobtrusive, sweet-sour fruitiness of grape works well with other fruits, or as a refreshing counterpoint to meat. You might want to savor the good ones by themselves.</span></span></p>

Freezing the grapes concentrates the flavors, and the resulting texture is somewhere between a sorbet and a Gummi Bear. You could bring out the flavor of almonds by toasting them for almond brittle; serve the brittle and the frozen grapes with the cheese course in separate glass or silver bowls, the brittle broken into sticky fragments. Another take on this pair is almond-studded cantuccini cookies dipped into rustic, raisiny Vin Santo, the (usually) sweet Tuscan wine that’s made with dried grapes.

Thompsons have medium-thick skin, so you’ll still need to peel them for your quail or chicken dish. As with tomatoes, blanching them beforehand will make the job that much easier if they’re not quite ripe.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span class="calibre5">Rhubarb is a vegetable native to Siberia. The leaves are poisonous; it’s the pink petioles, or stalks, that we eat. Once its intense sourness has been countered with sufficient quantities of sugar, the flavor becomes fascinating—a combination of aromatic, candied strawberry notes with a cooking-apple fruitiness, plus a strong, thick note redolent of a greenhouse full of ripening tomatoes. The fruity notes are able to withstand cooking, and retain their freshness even after sugar has been added. Rhubarb is best paired with overtly sweet ingredients, such as maple syrup, honey or anise, then smothered with even more sweetness in the form of vanilla, almonds, cream or butter. Some take advantage of its gooseberry/cooking-apple sourness to pair rhubarb with fatty meat and oily fish.</span></span></p>

More recently it’s likely to include whisky and raspberries. As the only raspberries you can buy in January are those tasteless grenades of pure sourness they sell in supermarkets, one Burns Night I devised this spin-off using rhubarb instead. Rhubarb has a similarly pleasing sharpness to raspberry, and I used Amaretto in place of the whisky—partly because almond is a natural partner for rhubarb, partly because its sweetness and lower alcohol content make it less of a hot shock than Scotch. Toast ½ cup oatmeal until golden brown and set aside to cool. Cut 6 stalks of rhubarb into 1-in pieces, place in a buttered ovenproof dish, sprinkle over ¾ cup sugar, cover with foil and bake at 350ºF for about 30 minutes. Remove and cool. Whip ¾ cup cream until it holds its shape, then fold in four-fifths of the toasted oatmeal, the cooked rhubarb, 2 tbsp Amaretto and 2 tbsp honey. Divide between 4 dishes and top each with the remaining oatmeal and a Highland fling of toasted almond slices.</span></span></p>

The secret was to overdo the sugar, which is surely what rhubarb’s celery-like, natural scoop shape encourages you to do. The effect was like a marginally healthier version of the sour gummies you find in candy stores—the mouthwatering citric shock at once tempered and intensified by the intense, crunchy sweetness. Until I read Paula Wolfert, I’d never thought of dipping rhubarb in salt, which a friend of hers reported people doing in Turkey. Further investigations yielded an Iranian recipe for thinly sliced cucumber and rhubarb tossed and left to stand for a while in salt, then mixed with arugula, lemon juice and a little mint, which Wolfert suggests as an accompaniment to poached salmon.</span></span></p>

In </span></span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">Plenty and Want</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre5">, John Burnett cites a week’s worth of menus for a typical English family in 1901. Rhubarb makes it into no fewer than six meals. Such ubiquity and ease of cultivation was a blessing during the two world wars but by the second half of the twentieth century the nation had grown heartily sick of rhubarb, boiled to a pulp and burbling in lumpy custard, especially as so many new foods became available. Rhubarb might have disappeared altogether had it not been for the diplomatic skill of vanilla. Which is just as well, as rhubarb is one of vanilla’s best friends: the contrast of luxurious, floral creaminess with rhubarb’s mouthwatering sour-fruity flavor—somewhat akin to passion fruit but without the heavy muskiness—is completely heavenly. And so rhubarb clung on, skirting obsolescence on the back of rhubarb crumble with vanilla ice cream and rhubarb tart with proper custard (which is out of this world, by the way, if you cook the rhubarb and custard together in the tart). And those shocking pink and yellow boiled sweets. Now, of course, rhubarb is popular again, thanks to renewed interest in seasonal food and growing your own. And how does it repay vanilla for sticking by it through the hard times? By looking for newer, more exotic partners, of course. See Rhubarb &amp; Saffron, <a href="#dummy_split_018.html#filepos1167466">*</a>, and Rhubarb &amp; Mango, <a href="#dummy_split_018.html#filepos1165072">*</a>.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span class="calibre5">Buying decent canned tomatoes is a good deal easier than buying tasty fresh ones. Look for Italian canned plum tomatoes—if it says San Marzano D.O.P. on the label, they’ll be good. The original San Marzano cultivar was more or less wiped out in the 1970s by the cucumber mosaic virus, but the kind available today is an approved replacement, with a fleshy texture that’s hard to beat for cooking. There are also some excellent organic brands from California. Canned tomatoes have been cooked a little (common for canned products) and will have developed a more sulfurous, jammy, spicy flavor than their raw counterpart. Raw tomatoes taste sour, sweet and salty, and have leafy, fruity and floral flavors. They’re at their best when they’ve been left to ripen properly on the vine, developing their optimal bold sweetness and acidity. If you can’t grow your own, store-bought cherry tomatoes are often the best bet for flavor. Or you could invest the money you might otherwise have wasted on premium-priced, but stingily flavored, varieties in a bottle of high quality balsamic vinegar, which will furnish the sweetness and acidity the tomatoes lack. (Incidentally, the flavor of strawberry is also intensified by balsamic vinegar; see Tomato &amp; Strawberry, <a href="#dummy_split_018.html#filepos1195356">*</a>, for their alleged interchangeability.) Tomato has an umami taste too. Heston Blumenthal, acting on a hunch that tomato seeds contain more flavor than the flesh, worked with scientists from Reading University to confirm that they are in fact richer in glutamic acids, which not only makes them particularly tasty but also boosts the flavor of other ingredients.</span></span></p>

Salty bacon and sweet-sour tomato. Famously good with crisp, bittersweet lettuce in a BLT. Not so good in the first dinner I cooked my then husband-to-be, pasta all’amatriciana. A safe bet, you’d think. I fried a dozen chopped slices of pancetta in olive oil until crisp, removed them from the pan and set them aside. Having softened a sliced onion in the bacon fat, I emptied in a can of whole plum tomatoes, broke them up with my wooden spoon and added 1 tsp each of chili flakes and sugar before seasoning. While that slowly simmered, I slipped into the bedroom and crammed all the discarded shoes, recipe books, home-gym equipment and candy wrappers into the wardrobe before nonchalantly returning to the kitchen to give my sauce a stir. A little more sugar, I thought, to balance the sharpness of the tomato—a sharpness that lingered on my palate, worryingly, as I withdrew to the bathroom. So much so that once I’d applied my eyeliner I had to pop back to the kitchen and add an extra teaspoon. And so on, teaspoon after teaspoon, until the sauce had taken on a candied glaze and might as well have been called pasta alla diabetica. I added the bacon to the sauce and reheated it. Cooked the pasta and drained it. Mixed it with the sauce and served it with pecorino romano. He ate it, but I’m sure I saw him wince. Nervous hosts should note that stress and anxiety can dull the ability to taste. Research carried out on people with seasonal affective disorder has shown a marked difference in the sufferer’s taste thresholds during the winter months.</span></span></p>

In Greece they cook lamb joints with tomatoes and add orzo, the rice-shaped pasta, toward the end. The pasta soaks up the lamb and tomato flavors. All it needs is a simple spinach salad on the side. Noting how long it will take to roast the meat to your taste, make slits in your lamb joint, poke slivers of garlic into them and season. Transfer the joint to a rack in a roasting pan and place on the middle shelf of an oven preheated to 375°F. Roughly chop the contents of two 14-oz cans of tomatoes, then stir in some oregano, a bay leaf, ½ tsp sugar and some seasoning. When the meat has an hour left to cook, working quickly, take the roasting pan out of the oven, set the lamb aside and drain the fat from the pan. Pour the tomatoes into the pan, rest the lamb on top of them and return to the oven. When the lamb’s cooking time is up, remove it and wrap loosely in foil to rest. Stir 1 cup orzo and ½ cup boiling water into the tomatoes and return to the oven. Once the meat has rested for 15 minutes, carve it, by which time the orzo should be cooked. Double-check it is, then serve slices of lamb on the pasta. See also Lamb &amp; Anise, <a href="#dummy_split_008.html#filepos208965">*</a>.</span></span></p>

She goes on to lament that such a pleasure was becoming increasingly rare in England. It’s almost nonexistent now. The only tomatoes that have ever really lived up to the ideal for me were the ones I ate at a beach restaurant in El Puerto de Santa María, between Jerez and Cádiz on the Costa de la Luz. It had garish plastic tablecloths covered by a layer of rough paper, held in place by fluorescent green table-clips. The tomatoes were fringed with green, the onions, just, well, onions. But both were exquisite: the tomato deep with chlorophyllic greenhouse flavor, the onions so sweet you could have blindfolded someone and convinced them they were slices of fruit.</span></span></p>

Later research discovered the highest concentrations were found in homegrown tomatoes in high summer. Try substituting one for the other in your favorite strawberry and tomato dishes.

It’s great with strawberries, allowing the fruit’s flavor to shine in a way that chocolate rarely can. It’s even better when strawberry’s sweetness is further emphasized by sugar—say, in a hazelnut meringue roulade filled with strawberries and whipped cream. For the hazelnut meringue, whisk 4 large egg whites to soft peaks. Continue to whisk while gradually adding 1 generous cup superfine sugar. Fold in 4 oz toasted ground hazelnuts, then spread the mixture onto a lined 10 x 14-in Swiss roll pan. Bake for 20 minutes at 375°F. Remove from the oven, cool, then turn out, peeling off the paper lining if still attached to the meringue. Cover with whipped cream and chopped strawberries. While the meringue is still pliable, roll it up with care. It’s not supposed to look perfect. And if you really make a mess of it, you can always go nuts, break it into pieces and call it Eton mess—a classic English dessert of broken meringue, berries and heavy cream. Hazelnuts share strawberry’s love of toffee-nosed flavors, so a swirl of caramel sauce is an excellent addition.</span></span></p>

You need to be very sure, combining raspberry and strawberry, that you wouldn’t be better off just plumping for one or the other. Note that when they are combined, it’s almost always for decorative purposes—on tarts, cheesecakes or pavlovas—but that as soon as the berry is blended or juiced beyond recognition they tend to go it alone, in jams, ices and drinks, which has to tell you something about the flavor combination.</span></span></p>

With whipped, pale-yellow cream in an Eton mess (see Strawberry &amp; Hazelnut, <a href="#dummy_split_018.html#filepos1203468">*</a>) or a pavlova, sitting pretty on a dense cheesecake, or, best of all, with clotted cream on a scone? For me, the combination of strawberry, with its strong candy flavor, and perfumed vanilla is too much—it almost tastes synthetic. On a slightly more positive note, of the three permutations available to the consumer of “classic” Neapolitan ice cream, strawberry and vanilla is the least bad. Isn’t it time for a new take on Neapolitan? It was originally made from a combination of all sorts of flavors, including pistachio, raspberry and coffee. And then it became that dull greatest-hits compilation of chocolate, vanilla and strawberry: a threesome of convenience. Pistachio in place of the chocolate would be an improvement. Rhubarb, strawberry and vanilla, a delight.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span class="calibre5">A cocktail all on its own. When properly ripe, pineapples combine an array of juicy fruit flavors with a spicy, boozy, candy quality redolent of the fruit’s classic partners—vanilla, rum, coconut and caramel. As they stop ripening once picked, commercially available pineapples are often seriously underripe, having failed to reach their full flavor and ideal balance of sourness and sweetness. To check the ripeness of a pineapple, smell its base—the fruitlets there are the oldest, and therefore the sweetest and most fragrant.</span></span></p>

With reviews like that, no wonder it’s such a diva. Pineapple won’t allow gelatin to set, curdles cream and reduces other foods to a pulp if you’re not careful.

Leaves that come away on tugging as an indicator of ripeness is an old wives’ tale. Sniffing its bottom isn’t: the juice in this part of the fruit tends to be sweeter, and when ripe its perfume will penetrate the armored peel. If it smells as if it’s been in the pub all afternoon, avoid it. I’ve found that medium-sized fruits tend to be sweeter and more flavorful than the larger varieties; and you’re generally safer buying them in winter and spring. If you do end up with a sour pineapple, try dipping pieces in chili and salt, as they do with green mangoes in Southeast Asia and Mexico. Sweet pineapple is good mixed with fresh red chilies too, especially in a salsa to accompany fish, or chopped up very finely and served with a mango sorbet.</span></span></p>

Soak 1 cup black beans in water overnight, drain and rinse, then bring them to the boil in a quart of the stock. Cover and simmer for 45 minutes–1 hour, by which time the beans should be soft. Remove about a quarter of the contents, blend and add back to the soup to thicken it. Before serving, stir in some cilantro and shredded fresh pineapple (cut a peeled, cored pineapple lengthways into 8 spears and then chop along the grain for short shreds). You can add some shredded ham if you fancy that, and if you don’t have good ham stock, you can always try softening an onion and some smoked bacon in the soup pot before adding the beans and a quart of water.</span></span></p>

But in 1969 the crew of Apollo 11 washed down their first lunar meal—bacon squares, peaches, sugar-cookie cubes—with a pineapple and grapefruit drink. I assumed this would have been Lilt, the pineapple-and-grapefruit soda with “the totally tropical taste” made by Coca-Cola and drunk by the teenage me in vast quantities, until I found out it was neither sold in the States nor launched until 1975, and wouldn’t have been appropriate anyway. Drinks taken on space missions had to be ones you could rehydrate, and, since carbon dioxide bubbles lack buoyancy in weightless conditions, even if an astronaut did manage to slurp down the frothy mass they wouldn’t be able to burp, leaving them with a gassy back-up they’d have to wait till re-entry to relieve. Zero gravity is also believed to have an adverse effect on flavor perception, as the particles by which we detect aroma are less likely to make it to our olfactory bulbs. Chances are the big flavors of pineapple and grapefruit were very welcome.

Other upside-down cakes have come in its wake (cranberry and peach, maple and pear, orange and cardamom), but none matches the magical fragrance of the original.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span class="calibre5">Inseparable from the refreshing, fruity, green flavor of apples is their crucial balance of sour and sweet. Imagine a continuum running from sweeter varieties such as Fuji and Gala, through middling Golden Delicious, tart Braeburn, Pink Lady and Granny Smith to the Bramley cooking apple at the sour extreme. The cultivar also dictates the presence of idiosyncratic flavor characteristics, such as floral (rose) or fruit notes like damson, pear, pineapple, strawberry and rhubarb. Apples might contain spicy notes too, such as nutmeg and anise, dairy notes like butter, cream and cheese, nutty notes—especially near the core, as the seeds have an almond flavor—or hints of honey, wine and bubblegum. Apples are the most cultivated fruit in temperate climates, not only on account of their superb flavor but because they are so versatile. Apart, of course, from their consumption raw, they’re excellent cooked in cakes, pies and puddings or made into jelly, piquant sauces, juice, cider and brandy.</span></span></p>

If, however, this is not your bag, a sharp apple will temper its richness. Try one part diced Braeburn to two parts diced cooked beet. Oh, and keep the apple skin on for the texture contrast. In time, the beets stain the mix a uniform red, which is pleasingly confusing to the brain when, expecting the soft resistance of beet, you crunch into a sweet morsel of apple. Both flavors work well with horseradish, so maybe mix a little into some mayonnaise for a dressing. Or walnut—another great match. Apple and beet with a walnut-oil-based dressing. Delicious with grilled oily fish.</span></span></p>

Once through the heavy door, you have to part a thick, faded velvet curtain to enter the dining room. This made me feel like Edmund stepping through the wardrobe into Narnia, except instead of arriving in a magical land of snow and ice and being seduced by Turkish Delight, I arrived in a 1930s Parisian workingmen’s café and was seduced by black pudding. Make this on a chilly autumn night when you yearn for something satisfying but snappy. Choose an eating apple that holds its shape, preferably a tangy one to offset the rich spiciness of black pudding. Peel and core the apple and cut into 8 wedges. Cook in a tablespoon each of butter and peanut oil until softened and lightly browned. Heat the black pudding in the same pan when the apples are nearly done: it’s already cooked, so it takes only a few minutes to heat through. Serve with nothing but a glass of cold, peachy Viognier.</span></span></p>

Apple is Simon, by the way, the dominant partner. Blackberry does the high notes. Blackberries have a spicy character, although not a specific spice. Pick a bagful of blackberries. Mix these in a pan with 4 peeled, cored and chopped cooking apples and about ¼ cup sugar. Cook on a low heat for about 20 minutes, until the apples are soft and the blackberries have stained the mixture a shiny crimson. Check for sweetness and add more sugar if necessary. We used to call this stewed fruit, but supermarkets now insist on calling it compote, which is more elegant on the ear but misses the sweet rustic rowdiness. Just a little cream will sweeten it further.</span></span></p>

Not wishing to sit on the fence, but it might simply come down to the apples and the time of year. An apple that packs plenty of character and acidity, like many cooking varieties, will make a lovely contrast to soft, buttery pastry, crumble or sponge, with no need to call for any backup on the flavor front. Some dessert apples also make the grade; Simon Hopkinson recommends Golden Delicious for apple tarts. Most dessert apples, however, don’t have enough acidity for that gorgeous fresh fruitiness to survive the cooking process, and are better eaten raw. Nonetheless, if needs must, the flavor of cooked dessert apples can be improved by a squeeze of lemon juice and a sweet spice such as clove or cinnamon. If you grow your own apples, or keep fresh apples bought from a farmer’s market in cold storage, you’ll notice that over time both cooking and dessert apples become less acid and more sweet: even a puckersome Bramley can develop into an eater, albeit a sharp one, by March.</span></span></p>

A friend once told me rather sniffily that the plowman’s lunch was a marketing confection.

A wedge of tangy mature Cheddar or Stilton, like a road sign warning of a steep hill ahead, with a whole apple, half a loaf of crumbly brown bread and some home-pickled onions and chutney. The sharpness of the apple cuts through the salty creaminess of the cheese, making it just the thing with good beer or cider. You could also try a sharp hard cheese with apple pie, as is the custom in Yorkshire and parts of America. Some take the cheese on the side, others bake it under the pastry crust. In Wisconsin a law was once passed banning the consumption of apple pie without cheese; Eugene Field (1850–95) wrote a poem to the pairing, and in </span></span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">Taxi Driver</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre5"> Travis Bickle orders apple pie with melted cheese in a coffee shop, some say in reference to a similar request made by the psychopath Ed Gein in exchange for a full confession.</span></span></p>

She gives a recipe for pears in nightshirts, in which whole pears are poached in cider, set on a bed of spiced apple purée, covered in meringue and baked until crisp and golden. You could replace the apple with a purée of quince, which, like apple and pear, is a pome fruit. Quince is famous for its heavy, sensual perfume, which at autumn farmers’ markets hangs as thickly in the air as Dior’s Poison on the platforms of London Underground stations circa 1987. Quince’s aroma is a combination of apple, pear, rose and honey, with a musky, tropical depth. Jane Grigson believed that it couldn’t be beaten as a flavoring for apple or pear tarts. Grate or finely chop a quince and mix it into a pie or tarte Tatin. Be sure to include the skin, where most of the flavor compounds are concentrated.</span></span></p>

With a plate of proper roast pork, by which I mean one with a curly roof of crackling, your apple pulls back the curtains and throws open the window of your palate. Make more applesauce than you need. Lots more. Nobody ever had too much of it—it’s so versatile. Put 2 lb of peeled, cored, chopped Bramleys, 1/3 cup sugar and 1–2 tbsp water in a saucepan.

<p><span><span class="calibre5">Pear is less acidic than its relative the apple, and less hardy, but it isn’t as dainty as you might think. The characteristic flavor of pear survives the canning process and, even more impressively, distillation into brandy. The Williams pear is the variety most commonly used in canning and brandy, as well as in many pear-flavored products. The Doyenne du Comice is a highly regarded pear for eating raw. Unveiled in 1849, it has been treasured for its quality ever since. It’s a butter pear, as are Bosc and Anjou, similarly prized for their rich, aromatic flavor and (as the name suggests) buttery texture. The sweet, vinous character of pear makes it a great partner for sharp cheeses or ingredients with a tannic edge, such as walnuts and red wine. The juicy crispness of the Nashi (or Asian) pear suits similar flavor combinations but has a more pear/melon character.</span></span></p>

For the same reason, cinnamon is a welcome addition to hearty hot pear puddings such as tarte Tatin, upside-down cake and clafoutis.

Pour over 1 cup boiling water, add 2 tbsp butter, cover and leave for 5 minutes. Rake the couscous with a fork to separate the grains. Add most of the pear and almonds, sprinkle over 2 tsp orange-flower water and ½ tsp ground cinnamon and stir well to combine. Serve piled into small bowls with a little pear and almond on the summits.

Core, quarter and slice 2 pears and drop into 2 cups acidulated water (i.e., water with 1 tbsp lemon juice added). Wash, drain, and, if necessary, chop your leaves: watercress, radicchio or chicory would work well. Crumble or cut 1 cup blue cheese. Roughly chop a generous handful of walnuts, toasting them first for a fuller flavor, or leaving them raw, which is fine. Make a dressing with 3 tbsp walnut oil, 1 tbsp olive oil, 2 tbsp sherry vinegar and some seasoning. Dress the leaves and toss with the walnuts, half the blue cheese and the drained pears. Scatter over the rest of the cheese and serve. Pear and walnut will also make a rich cake or tart. </span></span></p>

As it ripens, this develops into the familiar fresh, fruity banana flavor with a distinct note of clove. By the time the peel is mottled with brown, the fruit’s flavor is reminiscent of vanilla, honey and rum, as if anticipating its conversion into banana bread or its flambéing in a pan. Banana has a great affinity for roasted flavors such as coffee, nuts and chocolate, and for heavily spiced flavors like rum.</span></span></p>

Banoffee pie consists of a pastry or graham cracker base topped with caramel, banana slices and coffee-flavored cream—so you could say the etymology of “offee” splits two ways. I’d choose a digestive biscuit base over pastry, as its salty, malty flavor sets off the fresh green notes in just-ripe banana better. Coffee beans contain highly volatile aldehydes and esters that lend coffee its fragrant, floral notes and hints of sweet spices such as clove. Banana also has floral and clove components, so the two flavors combine rather pleasingly. Note how the coffee and bananas aren’t just lending flavor; they contribute bitter and sour tastes that strain against the pie’s desire to become a sweet, cloying headache.</span></span></p>

When allowed to ripen, all varieties of melon become sweet and share a basic melon flavor note; other than that there’s some variation, notably in depth of flavor and in the presence of fruity (pear and banana), floral and sulfurous characters. Cantaloupes develop a particularly floral and persistent flavor. Galias are known for their sweetness, and have a cucumber streak, sometimes with a hint of glue. Melons are easily mixed with other fruit, but their wateriness is one reason for their limited number of classic flavor affinities.</span></span></p>

Ginger was traditionally paired with melon because its warmth and stomach-soothing properties were thought to counter melon’s chilliness and resistance to easy digestion. With a tasting panel, I tried ground, preserved, fresh, crystallized and liqueur ginger with five different varieties of melon, and all combinations proved considerably worse than melon with no ginger at all. Even honeydew tasted worse with ginger, which is saying something, as this melon variety has always reminded me of those brands of attractively packaged European chewing gum that lose their flavor within one grind of the teeth. The marriage is therefore annulled. In this household at least.</span></span></p>

So prized have they been throughout the ages that, when asked by the mayor of Cavaillon if he would donate some of his books to the town library, Alexandre Dumas pledged his entire oeuvre in return for an annuity of 12 Cavaillon melons. To experience them at their very best, you really have to go to Provence in midsummer—although if you (or a friend) do make the trip, bear in mind that a bottle of the Cavaillon melon syrup made by the Domaine Eyguebelle will give a year-round glimpse of the deep beauty of this flavor.</span></span></p>

Better, perhaps, to stick to simple, unheated pairings, like cantaloupe with wild strawberries, as suggested by Elizabeth David.

The bakery spreads it only under the chocolate icing that tops the chocolate sponge gâteau. The hotel, which won the right to name its cake the original Sachertorte, also uses apricot jam to sandwich the layers together.</span></span></p>

Combine them in a cobbler—a baked fruit pudding with a scone-like topping arranged like paving stones over the fruit. A crumble with aspirations, in other words. Peel, stone and slice 4 peaches and mix them with a couple of handfuls of blackberries in a baking dish. Sprinkle over 3 tbsp sugar and dot with a little butter. Place 1½ cups plain flour, 4 tsp sugar, 1 tsp baking powder and 5 tbsp butter in a food processor and pulse until you have a mixture that resembles breadcrumbs. Add 4 tbsp milk and a lightly beaten egg through the feed tube. Pulse until the mixture becomes a dough. Remove it and knead briefly. Roll it out to a thickness of ½ in, cut out as many 1½–2-in discs as you can and lay them over the fruit. Bake at 400ºF for about 30 minutes.

By the way, elsewhere in Venice, in a bar in Campo Santa Margherita, you might try a </span></span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">spritz al bitter</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre5">, which classically combines Prosecco, mineral water and Campari.

<p><span><span class="calibre5">Like other nuts, coconut has a mild, milky, fruity flavor when fresh but becomes more boldly flavored when toasted or baked, taking on a creamy, nutty sweetness. In common with sweet almond, it has a flavor notably compatible with others, both sweet and savory. Coconut milk is usually made with grated coconut flesh and water, yet the canned brands can be surprisingly variable, especially in sugar content. Chaokoh, a Thai brand, has a good reputation for flavor, a low sugar content, and is particularly suitable for savory dishes. Coconut cream, separate from the milk, is also widely available, as are coconut milk powder, desiccated or flaked coconut (both sweetened and unsweetened), coconut flour, extract, essence and water, and the coconut-flavored rum, Malibu.</span></span></p>

Coconut studded with glacé cherries, topped with caramel and covered in milk chocolate. So sweet it made your teeth throb in unison, as if you’d strayed too close to the speakers at a disco. Coconut, like cherry and almond, is a drupe (or stone) fruit, and among its dominant creamy, nutty notes you can detect some fruitiness. Cherry, also fruity and nutty, is a particularly good match, and both work very well with chocolate. Judge for yourself with my cover version. I make them in a silicone mold divided into the ideal bar shapes, 3 in x 1 in x 1 in. Thoroughly beat an egg with ¼ cup sugar, then stir in 1¼ cups shredded coconut and about 15 quartered glacé cherries. Press this mixture into 10 bar shapes and bake for 15 minutes at 350ºF. Leave to cool while you make a toffee by melting 2 rounded tbsp sugar, 2 rounded tbsp butter and 2 tsp corn syrup in 1/3 cup condensed milk over a low heat. Turn up the heat, bring to the boil and cook for 4–5 minutes, by which time the mixture will have turned a caramel color. Allow to cool for a minute, then spread it over the coconut bars while they’re still in their molds. Once cool, cover with chocolate—milk if you want to be authentic.</span></span></p>

To this she added another pounded mixture of onions, ginger, red pepper, spice and fish paste cooked in coconut oil, before pouring over thick coconut milk and then lime juice. Madé insisted that the meal, served with rice, should be eaten with the hands, because they contributed to the flavor of the food. Cutlery, with its chill and metallic taint, would only get in the way.</span></span></p>

Even if it lacks the sharp acidity of lemon, the vivid citrus-floral character of lemongrass lightens the weighty fattiness of coconut. The lemoniness comes from citral, a combination of two compounds that exists at a low level in the essential oil of lemon and dominates that of lemongrass. Lemon verbena and lemon myrtle also contain high levels of citral and are sometimes used as substitutes for lemongrass. Kaffir limes, native to Southeast Asia, have a flavor and aroma closer to lemon than ordinary limes, due to the potent citrus-herbal character of their constituent compound, citronellal. You might also detect a slight flavor of pears, and a leathery, waxy quality consonant with its famous glossy leaves. Kaffir lime zest has a similar flavor and is sometimes added to curry pastes, as is the small amount of pungent, perfumed, sour juice. Lemon balm can be used as a substitute for kaffir lime leaves, as it contains comparably high levels of citronellal. Both lemongrass and kaffir lime partner with coconut for curries, seafood broths and delicately spiced chicken. And don’t overlook their sweet applications—they make great panna cotta and ice cream, or you can infuse coconut milk with lemongrass and use it for the recipe in Mango &amp; Coconut, <a href="#dummy_split_019.html#filepos1329866">*</a>.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span class="calibre5">Mangoes, the fruit of a tropical evergreen tree, generally taste sweet and have fruity, creamy and floral flavors, often with a hint of resin. There are, however, many cultivars and producing countries and, depending on its origins and level of ripeness, your mango might equally taste like a stringy canned peach soused in turpentine as a sleek fruit steeped in Gewürztraminer and vanilla cream. Mangoes make a harmonious match with other fruity, spicy and creamy ingredients, but care must be taken for the flavor not to dominate. The classic partner is fruity, spicy, bold-flavored lime: the two make a simple dessert. </span></span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">Amchoor</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre5"> is a mango powder prized in Indian cooking for the sourness it lends to dishes.</span></span></p>

They’re a little more porous than green mango, and you’ll need to get some lime juice on it right away to arrest the browning, but it’s a good enough substitute not to deny yourself a treat that, aside from its fresh crunchiness, holds the four main elements of Thai cuisine in perfect balance: chili heat, sweetness (from the sugar—traditionally palm), sourness (from the lime) and the saltiness brought by funky fish sauce. When I first discovered how easy </span></span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">som tam</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre5"> was to make, I got through a bottle of fish sauce faster than an unwatched kid gets through ketchup.

Core and coarsely grate a couple of Granny Smiths. Halve about 10 cherry tomatoes. Put the grated apple into a bowl and toss with lime juice to prevent browning. Add all the other ingredients, mix in the dressing and serve immediately. Ripe mango and apple, for their part, get along famously. Mango is definitely the older sibling, dominating apple if unchecked, but held in balance they make a mouthwateringly sweet-sour juice, apple’s freshness enfolded by the deep, heady creaminess of mango.</span></span></p>

The manner of production is incredibly romantic (though presumably less so for the grape pickers). The grapes are left on the vine through the autumn and into deep winter, when they’re harvested at below-freezing temperatures, often by moonlight. The frozen grapes are pressed and, because their sugar and flavor-imparting compounds have a lower freezing point than their inherent water, the highly concentrated juice can be separated from the water and skins. The resulting wine is both sweet and pingingly acidic, with pronounced fruit. Noble-rotted Rieslings can also fetch up mango and apricot, and have their own romance, grown in vineyards steeped in mist on the banks of the Rhine.</span></span></p>

It’s striking, given how polarizing their flavors can be, to reflect how popular mango and cilantro have become in the last ten years. Cilantro is now the bestselling herb in the UK, even if many people find its flavor “soapy” or (conversely) “dirty.” Chef and writer Julia Child thought it had a dead taste; others detect a nylon, doll’s-hair quality. Mango can have a resinous turpentine flavor, and in fact naturally contains trace amounts of kerosene.

Coconut sticky rice and mango is sold all over Thailand, from market stalls and shacks by the side of the road. To make it at home, soak 1 cup glutinous rice for at least a few hours, if not overnight. Drain it, line a steamer with cheesecloth and steam the rice for 20–25 minutes, until it’s cooked. Meanwhile, you can get on with dissolving sugar and salt into coconut milk over a low heat. Start out with roughly 2 tbsp sugar, a couple of pinches of salt and 1 cup coconut milk. Put the cooked rice in a bowl, let it cool a little, then gradually feed it the coconut milk until it can’t hold any more. Peel and slice a mango, taking care not to reduce it to mush, and serve it on the side of the rice, finishing the dish with a scattering of black sesame seeds, if you have them.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span class="calibre5">All citrus fruits lead double lives, the flavor of their juice being quite different from that of the peel. In the manufacturing of juice and other orange products, once the juice has been pressed from the ripe fruit, the peel is pressed separately to extract the aromatic liquid from its oil glands. Another oil, of a different character again, is distilled as a by-product when the juice is concentrated. These oils are used in soft drinks, or blended back into orange juice to improve the flavor without recourse to synthesized additives. All freshly squeezed fruit juice deteriorates pretty rapidly, so it’s always best to squeeze it on demand. Of all citrus fruits, orange is by far the most popular, especially when the term extends, as it does in this chapter, to mandarins, satsumas, blood and bitter oranges, as well as the dominant sweet orange. Its breadth of flavor characteristics guarantees that orange is highly compatible with other flavors. Sweet orange has the fruitiest flavor of all citrics, containing hints of mango and pineapple among its layers of generic citrus flavors, along with mild hints of spice and herb. Mandarins share the pleasing sweet-sourness of sweet orange, although the zest has a more noticeable herbal accent. Blood oranges usually add a berry, specifically raspberry, note to the sweetness. The zest of bitter oranges, such as Sevilles, has a stronger, waxy flavor with a hint of lavender. With the addition of plenty of sugar, their extremes of bitterness and sourness are what make marmalade so full-flavored and interesting. Bitter oranges are also used in most orange-flavored liqueurs, including Cointreau, Grand Marnier and Curaçao, and orange-flower water is made from their blossoms. Dried orange peel, for use as a flavoring, can be bought in Chinese and Middle Eastern supermarkets.</span></span></p>

It’s this thorough exhaustion of the fruit’s possibilities that gives the cake its deeply musky, spicy character, redolent of marmalade but without the sticky sweetness. The almond contributes the dense texture that makes the cake equally at home on the pudding plate as on the afternoon tea plate, especially if served with cream or a compote. In a nutshell, you boil 2 oranges in water for nearly 2 hours, until completely soft. Once cool, quarter them, discard the seeds and process the oranges to a pulp. Beat 6 eggs in a large  bowl, then mix in 2¼ cups ground almonds, 1¼ cup sugar, 1 tsp baking powder and the orange pulp. Pour into a greased and lined, deep, round 9-in cake pan. Bake at 375°F for an hour. Between you and me, the oranges can be microwaved in a few minutes if you’re short of time.</span></span></p>

When both went back into production after the war, orange quickly overtook apple in popularity and the latter was discontinued in 1954. The Chocolate Orange finally grew up in 1975 when the dark chocolate version was introduced, its bitter astringency complementing the sweet muskiness of orange oil far better than frumpy, facetious milk.</span></span></p>

For a sandwich, try grating the cheese and using a fine-cut marmalade, as thick hyphens of orange might prove too dominant. Walnut bread would be excellent. Alternatively make “jam” tarts using marmalade mixed with grated Cheddar. Fill little cheese pastry tarts and bake at 425ºF for about 15 minutes, taking special care not to burn them.</span></span></p>

The adult palate can generally take only so many sweet drinks before tiring of them. This is less of a problem with alcoholic drinks, which generally have a balancing bitterness to them. Orange and lemon zest (or the harder-core mixed peel) are also used to flavor, and balance the sweetness of, puddings and cakes. The Meyer lemon, big in the United States but a rare find in the UK (because it doesn’t travel well), is a lemon-orange hybrid, with a pronounced floral nose and flavor. It’s low in acid, so is seen as a sort of sweet lemon, as Sevilles are sour oranges—see Orange &amp; White Fish, <a href="#dummy_split_020.html#filepos1361788">*</a>.</span></span></p>

Good flower waters are made in Iran, while in Lebanon an artisan company called Mymouné uses traditional distillation methods and no artificial ingredients. The key for both is to use them by the drop, not the teaspoon, so they bring a mysterious background note to the dish, like a shimmer from a zither, not the thudding of the drum. They’re traditionally used in North African cooking in lamb and chicken tagines and all sorts of almond puddings and cakes; in France to flavor madeleines; and to add a floral note to fruit juices (especially orange) and grated carrot salads.

Both make refreshing (and variably bitter) sorbets paired with Campari, but the respective effects they have on the drink are more easily understood in the highball glass. Orange juice is the way in, the stabilizers on the frightening bike ride into Campari territory, helping to suppress its weird herbal notes and bitterness so stringent that your brain, at least on the first few attempts, flicks into alert mode at the influx of toxicity. Grapefruit, on the other hand, is pretty bitter itself, with its own extraordinary, herbal-fruity notes, and mixed with Campari makes a gloriously complex drink.</span></span></p>

Appropriately enough, perhaps, as of all the citrus family grapefruit surely has the most alien flavor. Nootkatone, the most important (i.e., “grapefruity”) compound, has a warm, woody character that is present but suppressed in other citrus fruits by their more dominant compounds. Grapefruit mercaptan, which is primarily responsible for the smell of grapefruit and lends a musky, tropical top note to the flavor, has one of the lowest aroma thresholds known to science. That is, it’s so potent that it can be detected in extremely minute quantities—0.0001 parts per billion, to be exact. Grapefruit’s odd, standoffish flavor has earned it a special place in </span></span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">haute cuisine</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre5">; at Les Jumeaux, the Parisian restaurant run by the Gillaizeau twins, scallops are served with a split pea purée and pink grapefruit sauce; at Chez Jean, they’re sautéed with chanterelle mushrooms, Chinese noodles and slices of pink grapefruit. More recently the vogue for grapefruit has been challenged by the yuzu, a small, wrinkled fruit big in Japan. Yuzu has a lemon-lime flavor, with hints of tangerine, grapefruit and pine, and is prized primarily for its aromatic peel, although the juice is used too. A very rough substitute can be made with equal parts lime and grapefruit juice. At Jean Georges in New York, your waiter might spray your plate of scallops with a spritz of yuzu juice.

Much of what is produced is used for flavoring cola. Lime juice is notably acidic, which accounts for its palate-cleansing qualities, and can seem quite salty squeezed on a salsa. Its sourness and bitterness work wonders set against a correspondingly determined sweetness—caramel in cola, for instance, butternut squash, or condensed milk in a key lime pie. The cultivar most widely available in the UK is the Persian lime, of which the citron and key lime are thought to be the parents. Key limes are smaller, thicker-skinned and, unlike most Persian limes, have seeds. They’re said to have a distinct flavor but, having hauled a bag home from the States to make an authentic key lime pie, I couldn’t detect much difference. Lime flavor is also contributed by musky dried limes (whole or ground), spicy lime pickle, lime marmalade and lime cordial.

Make a simple syrup by gently heating 1 cup vanilla sugar and several sticks of cassia (or cinnamon) in 1 cup water until the sugar has dissolved. Bring to a simmer, then cool. Keep in the fridge until the cinnamon has imparted a strong flavor to the syrup, then strain. Juice 3 limes, strain and add to ¾ cup of the cinnamon syrup with 2 tsp lemon juice and ½ cup water.

My theory is that the sour lime and refreshing mint come together with the kick of rum and the sugar rush to create something that sits at the crossroads of amphetamine and aromatherapy. Put 1 tbsp superfine sugar in a highball glass with 2–3 tbsp lime juice. Add a leafy sprig of mint and fill to about a third full with soda water. Muddle to dissolve the sugar and release the essential oils in the mint. Add about 3 tbsp Havana Club and a handful of ice cubes. Listen to their seismic creak. Stir, then garnish with more mint and a straw. If strong enough, the mojito will produce a pleasurably painful perceptual sharpening, like putting on glasses when you’re already wearing contact lenses. Or try a lime sorbet served with a shot of rum and garnished with mint leaves.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span class="calibre5">Lemon zest contains a compound called citral that is immediately recognizable as lemony. Aromatic notes of rose, lavender and pine are also present, as is a slight herbaceousness; all these are released when you grate lemon zest. The juice has a clean, fresh flavor, dominated by citric acid. It can be used in moderation to give an unidentifiable lift to a dish, or in greater quantities to lend a definite lemon flavor. Lemon is highly combinable and adaptable: in sweet or savory dishes, as a seasoning or star ingredient, in everything from apéritifs to petits fours. Pull it to extremes in a sweet lemon tart, sour lemon candy, bitter-lemon soft drinks and Middle Eastern salted preserved lemons. Lemon flavor is also dominant in the Italian liqueur limoncello, in lemon curd and in the exquisite lemon-sherbet hard candy that smell like lemon myrtle.

The knee-jerk reaction is to use lemon and dill for fish, but in Greece, where the partnership is extremely popular, lemon and dill are used far more widely: with lamb, with vegetables, and mixed into rice with onion and pine nuts to serve with feta. The combination is valued for its freshening effect and its ability to emphasize the sweetness of other ingredients.</span></span></p>

Lemon sauce is an established partner for ginger puddings, lemon icing is good on ginger cakes and the two combine in a hot toddy whose deliciousness may unfortunately pass you by when you’re most in need of one. Being clogged up is a good, if unwelcome, demonstration of how much your nose contributes to flavor recognition. The taste receptors in your tongue detect sweetness, saltiness, bitterness, sourness and “umami,” or savoriness, but it’s your olfactory nerve endings that detect the subtler differences between the lemony flavor in ginger and the lemony flavor in lemon. Try this toddy while your olfactory bulb is in full working order. Put a ¼-in piece of fresh ginger in a glass with the juice of ¼ lemon, 1–2 tsp honey and 1 tbsp whisky, rum or brandy. Top up with boiling water, stir and leave to infuse until it’s cool enough to drink.</span></span></p>

In India, roughly mashed potato is mixed with lemon juice, breadcrumbs, cilantro and chili, formed into pancakes, then deep-fried and served as a snack with chutney and yogurt. New potatoes might be dressed with lemon-infused olive oil or a lemon-laced vinaigrette. Mashed potato with lemon and black pepper can be very good with fish. And Mrs. Leyel gave a recipe for lemon cream pie, made by mixing a grated potato, the zest and juice of a lemon, a cup of sugar and a cup of water, then baking it in a double crust.</span></span></p>

Beat 2 egg yolks with ¼ cup superfine sugar and 2 tsp cornstarch until smooth. Scald 1¼ cups whipping cream, remove from the heat and beat in 2 tsp liquid glucose. Gradually add the cream mixture to the egg mixture and whisk together before returning all to the pan and heating, stirring constantly, to a custard thickness. Remove, pour into a clean bowl and cover the surface of the custard with cling wrap. Leave to cool, stir in about 20 drops of rosemary essence, then chill in the fridge before freezing.</span></span></p>

This way, some mouthfuls are alive with citrus zing, others with a quieter, relieving sweetness. It’s this balance of tastes that makes paella so dangerously easy to eat in vaster quantities than more monotonous meals, which must explain why Spanish cookshops sell paella pans as big as the satellite dishes at Very Large Array, New Mexico.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span class="calibre5">Native to Southeast Asia but now widely cultivated, ginger varies considerably in flavor depending on where it is grown. In general, fresh ginger is lemony, woody and earthy, with a kick of heat. Jamaican ginger grown in Jamaica is known for its fine quality. Jamaican ginger grown in Nigeria and Sierra Leone is characterized by its richness, pungency and a camphorous element that particularly distinguishes it from the more lemony varieties and betrays its relation to cardamom. Australian ginger is said to be the lemoniest, as of all varieties it contains the most lemon-flavored citral in its oil. Popular the world over as both a sweet and a savory ingredient, ginger is available fresh, dried, ground, glacé, pickled, preserved in syrup, juiced and in both soft and alcoholic drinks.</span></span></p>

The same ingredients make up a popular English blend now rather drily called “mixed spice.” It used to be called pudding spice, which was a far better name, not only because it’s more evocative but because it avoids confusion with allspice, which is a different thing altogether. As an aside, allspice is not a blend but a single spice, which looks like a black peppercorn and has a flavor dominated by eugenol, the compound that gives clove its flavor. It’s called allspice because it also contains notes of cinnamon and nutmeg. See also Butternut Squash &amp; Rosemary, <a href="#dummy_split_017.html#filepos1053423">*</a>.</span></span></p>

As it’s so popular, you might want to give it a whirl. The sauce is simply fresh chili pounded with fresh ginger and garlic, sometimes loosened with a little vinegar, lime juice or stock. The chicken is poached whole in salted water with ginger and scallion. The rice should be cooked with some fat from the cavity in the chicken and the water it was cooked in, now a fragrant stock. The bird is served in pieces at room temperature, drizzled with soy and sesame oil, with the ginger and chili dipping sauce on the side. Sounds easy, but the skill is in arranging the skinless chicken neatly on the serving dish, almost as if you’re trying to reassemble it.</span></span></p>

When the shell is peeled off, the white will have set and turned an amber color, like cold tea jelly, and the yolk a dark gray-green. They have a sulfurous odor and a pungent ammonia flavor, and are served with slices of pickled ginger as a casual snack. The English preserved egg is boiled, peeled and pickled in vinegar and is commonly sold in chip shops and pubs. In the pub, a tradition persists of burying the pickled egg in a packet of scrunched-up potato chips (a good barman will do this for you). Salt and vinegar chips are the typical flavor used, but Worcestershire sauce, with its sweet and sour spiciness, is a superior choice.</span></span></p>

Delia Smith combines cooked rhubarb with orange jelly made with ginger beer instead of the usual water.

Add 2 tsp powdered ginger, 2 tsp salt, the cloves of 1 whole garlic bulb, finely chopped, 2 tbsp vinegar and a pinch of cayenne. Pour into bottles and store somewhere cool. It can be eaten immediately but the flavors improve noticeably after a few weeks. It will taste even better if you’ve powdered your own ginger. Simply grate some fresh onto a baking sheet and leave to dry for 3–4 days, less if outside on a run of sunny days. Keep the dried gratings in a jar and whiz in a spice grinder when needed. You can leave the skin on for an earthier, nuttier flavor, or peel if you like it lighter.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span class="calibre5">Open a jar of cardamom pods and you might be reminded of a vapor rub or sinus-clearing stick. Like bay leaves and rosemary, cardamom contains clear notes of camphor and eucalyptus. As a member of the ginger family, it also has a citrus, floral quality; depending on their country of origin, cardamoms are likely to be stronger in eucalyptus or floral-citrus flavors. Whichever dominates, those fresh notes are good for cutting through fattiness, especially with ingredients that let the spice’s complexity of flavor shine—e.g., cream, chocolate, nuts or buttery rice.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span class="calibre5">Rosemary has a eucalyptus character akin to sage, although it contains more pine and floral notes and is sweeter. There are many varieties of rosemary. Among those particularly commended for their flavor are Tuscan Blue, which has a gentle, lemon-pine aroma, Spice Island, which has hints of clove and nutmeg, and Sissinghurst Blue, which has a pronounced smoky character that begs to be thrown on the barbecue. Rosemary tastes fine when it’s dried carefully, but it does take on the typically hay-like flavor of dried herbs, and noticeably loses the complexity of fresh. It is a classic partner for lamb and goat cheese, but also makes some excellent matches in sweet dishes with chocolate, oranges and lemons.</span></span></p>

The crumbly pastry gives a pleasing contrast to the rich, chewy filling, which can be made with all manner of dried fruit and nut combinations. When dried, apricots lose some of their fruity, lavender aroma and can become rather sour. Rosemary, reminiscent of lavender, restores some of their subtle perfume. Tip 1¾ cups plain flour into a food processor, add 1 stick unsalted butter, cut in small cubes, and whiz into crumbs. Little by little, add 1 tbsp rosewater and 3–4 tbsp milk until a dough forms. Set aside in the fridge. Put ½ cup chopped dried apricots in a pan with 2/3 cup chopped mixed nuts, 1 tbsp finely chopped rosemary, ¼ cup sugar and 4 tbsp water. Cook over a medium heat until the water has evaporated, then stir in ½ cup ground almonds and make sure all is well combined. When the mixture has cooled a little, divide the dough into 20 and roll each piece into a ball. Indent with your thumb to create a bowl and fill with the apricot mixture, easing the pastry over it until it’s no longer visible. Place them on a greased baking tray and flatten a little with the tines of a fork. Bake for 20 minutes at 325°F. Once cool, sprinkle with confectioners’ sugar.</span></span></p>

If this recalls the lovely combination of Chocolate &amp; Cardamom <a href="#dummy_split_007.html#filepos31596">*</a>, that’s because the dominant flavor compound in both rosemary and cardamom is cineole, common to bay leaf too (think how all three make great milk-based desserts). Cineole has woody, eucalyptus, slightly minty notes. In rosemary, these are joined by peppery, camphorous characters, while cardamom takes it in a more citrusy, floral direction—you might say chocolate with rosemary is a wintry alternative to chocolate and cardamom. This recipe for “Little Pots of Chocolate and Rosemary Cream” was conceived by the chef David Wilson. In a heavy-based stainless-steel pan, mix 1¼ cups superfine sugar with 1 cup dry white wine and the juice of ½ lemon. Heat gently until the sugar has dissolved, stirring occasionally. Stir in 2½ cups heavy cream and cook gently, stirring constantly, until thickened. Add 1 stem of rosemary (or 1 tsp dried rosemary) and 6 oz grated dark chocolate. Bring to the boil, stirring until the chocolate has dissolved, then lower the heat and simmer for 20 minutes, until the mixture is dark and thick. Cool, strain into 8 little pots (or even 10, it’s very rich), cover and refrigerate before serving.</span></span></p>

The key, it transpired, was to marinate the fruit in honey and rosemary for a couple of days.

Or scent the smoke by throwing a handful of sprigs onto the coals when your meat or veg is nearly cooked. The American food writer Mark Bittman suggests grilling watermelon steaks with rosemary. Cut 2-in-thick “steaks” (including the rind) from a small watermelon. With the tines of a fork, flick out as many seeds as you can without ruining the flesh. Brush the steaks with a mixture of 4 tbsp olive oil, 1 tbsp finely chopped rosemary, salt and pepper, then barbecue for 5 minutes on each side. Serve with lemon wedges.

Still, it’s a lovely cold-weather combination: use it to furnish poultry with a deep, satisfying stuffing or make a pork stew with sage and apple dumplings. To make the dumplings, put 1½ cups self-rising flour in a bowl with a rounded ½ cup suet, 8–10 finely chopped sage leaves and 1 peeled, cored and finely diced small cooking apple. Gradually mix in enough cold water to make a sticky but still workable dough. Shape it into dumplings with a pair of serving spoons, as you would quenelles.

It’s like French-kissing a scarecrow: straw and damp vegetables. Cooking brings out its sweeter, softer nature, unless it’s partnered with sage. Sage’s assertive flavor rubs off on the squash, revealing its meaty, virile side—so much so that a sworn carnivore might be won around to this pairing. The Chez Panisse café combines them on a pizza with Asiago cheese, while Russ Parsons gives a recipe for a butternut squash risotto garnished with fried sage leaves and toasted walnuts.</span></span></p>

Crush 1 clove of garlic with 1 tsp salt and mix into ½ cup Greek yogurt with some freshly ground pepper. Set aside and put 4 eggs on to poach. While the eggs are cooking, heat 1 stick unsalted butter in a pan, add 16 sage leaves and cook until the sage is crisp and the butter browned. Spoon a dollop of yogurt onto each plate, top with a poached egg, season with salt, pepper and a pinch of chili powder and finish by drizzling over the butter. Perry suggests some chopped fresh chili on the side. You can always fry the eggs, if you prefer.</span></span></p>

The English, she claimed, had become accustomed to the herb through its common pairing with goose and duck, especially in the form of sage and onion stuffing. These days, most English people are more likely to associate the flavor of sage with pork, as it’s so often used in sausages. In Italy a pork loin might be cooked slowly in sage- and lemon-scented milk. I’ve made this at home but, far from my flavor memory transporting me to the rusty-red rooftops and shadowy porticoes of Bologna, the ineradicable sausage association yanks me straight back to the cheerless breakfast room of a lochside B&amp;B in Scotland, scraping at my plate in the deafening silence.</span></span></p>

He also approves of gin with ginger beer and plenty of ice, “one of the great long drinks of our time.”</span></span></p>

Which is why, in turn, lemon is such a classic partner for gin—floated in a G&amp;T, juiced in a Tom Collins, in a classic gin fizz (with sugar, soda and ice), or in the mixer, bitter lemon, whose bitterness comes, as with tonic water, from quinine.</span></span></p>

Common thyme is the type you brush past on the mountain trails and coastal paths of the Mediterranean; strong, with a sweet, herbaceous warmth that can tip into smokiness or a medicinal quality. For me, thyme is the essence of the word herbal—almost neutrally so—and forms the backbone of a bouquet garni or </span></span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">herbes de Provence</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre5">. Its bittersweet, aromatic flavor flourishes in slow-cooked tomato sauces, braised meat dishes and bean stews.

Don’t worry if you don’t have any fresh—dried can be even better.

Thomas Keller serves them together at The French Laundry in California’s Napa Valley and at Per Se in New York, where, before your eyes, dark lids of chocolate are sprinkled with Maldon sea salt, then anointed with hot olive oil, which melts through the chocolate to reveal the thyme ice cream underneath. At Taillevent, the Parisian restaurant where Keller once worked, they have been known to serve thyme ice cream with a </span></span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">moelleux au chocolat </span></span></span><span><span class="calibre5">(molten chocolate cake), which is somewhat easier to reproduce at home. Taste the thyme custard before its second heating and I think you have a clue as to why this pair seems to work so well. The thyme makes the cream taste as if it came farm-fresh from the churn, more pasture than pasteurized, and the dark chocolate like the freshest milk chocolate in the mouth. To make thyme ice cream, put about 10 leafy thyme sprigs in a pan with 1¼ cups full-cream milk, scald, then leave to cool. Cover and steep overnight in the fridge. The following day, scald the milk and thyme again, then strain. In a bowl, beat 4 egg yolks with ½ cup superfine sugar, then slowly pour the warm, thyme-infused milk onto that mixture, stirring all the time. Transfer to a clean pan and stir over a low heat, without letting it boil, until the mixture is thick enough to coat the back of the spoon. Strain through a fine sieve, stir in 1¼ cups heavy cream, then cool and freeze in the usual way while you get on with making the cakes. You can’t go wrong with Galton Blackiston’s recipe for melting chocolate puddings, passed on by Delia Smith in several of her books and on her Web site.</span></span></p>

Season, then bring to the boil and simmer for about 15 minutes. Leave to cool slightly, discard the thyme, liquefy and reheat to serve. Add a swirl of cream and some tiny thyme leaves if the spirit takes you.</span></span></p>

Inhale the spritz as you’re peeling a mandarin and you’ll detect a beautiful herbal quality amid the citric zing. Orange and thyme are paired together far less than lemon and thyme but when they are, they often turn up with gamy poultry such as guinea fowl or turkey. The flavors of thyme and orange also occur naturally in orange balsam thyme, which can be hard to find but has a perfumed, musky orange-peel flavor that’s popular in West Indian cooking and used to be a standard seasoning for beef.

On a trip to the Dordogne it rained all morning, most of the afternoon and torrentially for a large part of the night. When it did let up, it was only for the clouds to accumulate fat raindrops of laughter to weep the moment anyone tiptoed toward the barbecue. Optimistically I had planned to cook garlicky pork sausages and thyme-fried onions to stuff into French bread smeared with Dijon mustard. Royally rained off, I put Plan B into action. Swaddled in layers of shapeless walking clothes, I braved the cold, dank kitchen, attached the gas to the stove and went through a box and a half of soggy matches trying to light the blasted thing. Once I had, I found a cast-iron pot, cleared it of spiders, and put in oil, the sausages, some roughly sliced onions and a jar of sinister-looking beans. From the overgrown garden I plucked a sprig of thyme, vivid green from its soaking, and threw it in the pot with salt, pepper and a long slug of wine. Putting it in the oven, with a prayer to the presiding spirit of butane, I went to sit by the fire that my husband had made from a stack of tatty paperbacks about idealistic English people making an ultimately rewarding hash of moving to France or Tuscany, called things like </span></span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">Stumbling on Artichokes</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre5"> or </span></span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">Nothing Toulouse</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre5">. I peeled off a few layers of Gore-Tex and fleece. Gradually the smell of pork, thyme and garlic displaced the fungal reek of long-empty vacation home. Beans have an amplifying effect on the aroma and flavors of food. It started to feel just a little homey. Of course you’d be completely glorifying my dish to call it a cassoulet, but then you’d be glorifying my five days in France to call it a vacation.</span></span></p>

In robust shellfish stews (or Manhattan and New England chowders), however, it furnishes a deliciously spicy, minty-herbal background note. This simple dish will give you a taster. Soften ½ chopped onion in olive oil, then add a can of drained, rinsed cannellini beans and a stem of fresh thyme. Season and leave to simmer very gently while you fry some shrimp in butter and garlic. Remove the herb from the beans and serve them in a neat heap with the shrimp on top.</span></span></p>

Thyme’s flavor comes from a phenolic compound called thymol, which tastes like a softer, friendlier version of carvacrol, the main flavor compound in oregano. Oregano’s secondary flavor compound is thymol, thyme’s carvacrol, so they have a lot in common. Clearly they can be paired with similar flavors—lamb, goat cheese and garlic, although oregano turns up less frequently in sweet dishes (that said, chef Claude Bosi serves a chilled soup of Jaffa orange and yogurt with oregano ice cream). And it’s said that American servicemen, returning home after the Second World War with a taste for pizza made with oregano, created a market for the cultivated herb—until the mid-twentieth century it was grown on only a small scale in the United States.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span class="calibre5">Mint is moody. Turns black when you chop it with a knife. In the UK, spearmint is paired with summer produce such as new potatoes, soft fruits, baby carrots and peas, and if you’re not careful their delicate flavors can be overwhelmed by its sweet melancholy. Mint really cheers up when it’s partnered with strong flavors, as in a richly beefy Vietnamese </span></span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">pho</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre5">, or chargrilled lamb kebabs, feta cheese or dark chocolate. In the Middle East peppermint is sometimes combined with lemon verbena to make a soothing tea. The different flavor of peppermint is attributable in part to its cooling menthol content. Peppermint is grown predominantly for its essential oil, used in candy, ice cream, dental products and the mint-flavored liqueur crème de menthe.</span></span></p>

Mint with bitter dark chocolate, on the other hand, you can feed me till my teeth ache. It was around Christmas 1978 that I realized the potency of the After Eight mint as a symbol of infinity. First, it was </span></span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">always</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre5"> after eight, if you thought about it. Second, there was the subtle, if not occult, clue embedded in the name: After 8 . . . After 8. What came after 8? Nothing. </span></span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">Exactly</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre5">. Then there was the wafer-thin mint itself. First the delicate snap of dark chocolate, bitter as plum skin. Then soft fondant so sweet your ears start straining back, until the peppermint invades your nasal passages like an inhalation, not so much refreshing your palate as dry-cleaning it, and leaving you fidgety for your next hit of chocolate before you’ve tongued the last trace of fondant from the roof of your mouth. All seemed powerful arguments for </span></span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">never stopping eating</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre5">. And the packaging smells so good. The crisp foil of a Bendicks chocolate mint isn’t a patch on the After Eight’s musky black envelope. I could imagine tearing them open, like those fold-out samples you get in magazines, and smearing a hint of Nestlé’s No.8 behind each ear.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span class="calibre5">An evocative combination of fruity, herbal and musky flavors, with a sour taste. Black currants have a distinct hedgerow aroma—the gorgeous, heady fragrance of country lanes on late-summer evenings. To make them properly palatable, sugar or honey must be added in increments in order to reach the optimal sweet spot. Like all dark berries, black currant loves apple, but to see what an exciting flavor it can be, it has to be tried with other bold flavors, such as juniper, peanut and coffee.</span></span></p>

If the volume of black currants seems conservative, that’s because their flavor is so intense—it would be counterproductive to use more. The nuts are given a boost by almond extract, which gives the cake a marzipan-like flavor. Cream 1¾ sticks butter with 1 cup superfine sugar. When the mixture has gone pale, add 3 eggs, one at a time, beating in well. Fold in 2 cups ground almonds and 1 tsp almond extract. Put the mixture in a greased and lined 10-in loose-bottomed pan and scatter over ½ lb black currants. Cook for 30 minutes at 350°F until golden and firm to the touch. Sift some confectioners’ sugar over before serving with cream, crème fraîche or Greek yogurt.</span></span></p>

But wine wasn’t sold much in pubs back then.) If you wanted black currant in something daintier than beer, you’d order a Pernod and black, which tasted like those black currant sweets you sucked until the fruity coating cracked and—a little disturbingly, as in a dream of broken teeth—gave access to the soft, slightly salty licorice center. I relive this combination by pairing a tangy black currant sorbet with pastis ice cream. For the pastis ice cream, combine 1 cup heavy cream, 1 cup milk, 4 egg yolks and ¾ cup superfine sugar in a heavy-bottomed saucepan. Cook over a low heat, stirring constantly, until the custard is thicker than cream. Strain the custard immediately into a bowl and stir for a minute or so. When cool, chill in the fridge until good and cold. Add 3 tbsp Pernod or Ricard and freeze according to your usual method. For the black currant sorbet, put 1½ cups water and 1 cup superfine sugar in a pan and heat gently, stirring now and then, until the sugar has dissolved. Add 1 lb black currants and cook gently, covered, for about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat, cool and pass through a fine sieve. Chill, then freeze in the usual way.</span></span></p>

Who were they kidding, not using black currant? And who was I, a Limey, to complain? Smuckers, manufacturers of America’s market-leading Jif peanut butter, claims the PB&amp;J dates from World War II, when GIs were supplied with both products in their rations. In the absence of actual butter, you can see how the peanut variety might have caught on. After the war, the popularity of the sandwich skyrocketed but, without wanting to turn my nose up at something almost as American as apple pie, I couldn’t see how sweet strawberry or grape could have been thought a better partner for fatty, salty peanut butter than the sharp and complex black currant. I didn’t know that black currants were, in fact, rarely eaten in the States. At the turn of the twentieth century it was discovered that the black currant plant, </span></span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">Ribes negrum</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre5">, was a vector for a disease that affected the white pine tree, which was vital to the booming construction industry. Growing black currants became a crime under federal law, and although enforcement of the ban has since been shifted to state jurisdiction, only a few states have lifted it. So the flavor is much less familiar to the American than the European palate. Where our purple sweets are almost always black currant flavor, American purple candies are grape—specifically Concord grape, derived from a species native to North America. Although black currant and Concord grape are easily distinguishable as flavors, both share a “catty” quality in common with Sauvignon Blanc, gooseberries and green tea.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span class="calibre5">Store-bought or cultivated blackberries, tall as beehive hairdos, bright as spit-and-polished toecaps, may sometimes be pleasantly sweet but they never, ever have the countervailing intensity of sharpness, mustiness and deep spice that comes of growing in the wild. There are hundreds of different strains of wild blackberry, and a berry picked in one spot may taste quite different from another a few feet away. Look for notes of rose, mint, cedar and clove beyond the generic berry flavors. Some even have a shimmer of tropical fruit. Come late August, when there should be plenty to choose from, treat the bushes like free-sample ladies, and once you’ve found a juicy, full-flavored strain, denude the bush until your ice-cream carton is full. Black, shiny fruit won’t be as sweet as those that have reached the matt blue-black of full ripeness, but then again, they’re less likely, having retained their bulbous resistance, to dissolve in your grasp like a teenager’s handshake. Although blackberries can add a fruity, spicy flavor to sweet vanilla cakes or sauces for game, they have an overriding affinity for apple—so much so they could almost be monogamous.</span></span></p>

To confuse matters, there are such things as black raspberries and red blackberries. A surefire way of telling one species from the other is whether or not the core of the fruit stays inside the berry when picked—raspberries come away clean, leaving that characteristic cavity, which I used to love peering into as a child; blackberries retain their woody flower base. Then there are the many raspberry–blackberry crosses. Loganberry, the oldest, is thought to have been an accident. In California in the late 1880s, the lawyer and horticulturist James Harvey Logan, attempting to cross two American varieties of blackberry, accidentally planted them next to an old European raspberry cultivar and the two species got friendly. Like many unplanned offspring, loganberry has had its identity crises, and is given to sourness. But it’s more suited to cooking than the raspberry. Further hybrids include the tayberry, tummelberry and boysenberry, which, even more conflicted about its parentage, contains unmistakable strawberry notes.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span class="calibre5">Raspberries have a sweet-sour taste and a fruity, floral (especially violet), leafy flavor; their seeds contribute a warm, woody note. When ripe, they have an intense, perfumed quality and a sweetness that hints at raspberry jam. The ubiquity of raspberry flavor can blind one to its loveliness, but there are few more delightful starts to the day than a spread of good raspberry jam on buttered toast. Raspberry flavor mixes harmoniously with other sweet-sour fruits such as apricot, blackberry and pineapple, as well as some of the lighter herbal flavors. Like strawberries, raspberries have some inherent dairy notes, which make them especially delicious with cream, yogurt and soft cheeses.</span></span></p>

The nut planes down the fruit’s sharper corners but never gets in the way of its sublime flavor. Try them together in an almond panna cotta with raspberry sauce or in a Bakewell tart (an open jam tart smothered in frangipane), made as follows. Line an 8-in tart pan with sweet pastry and spread about 3 tbsp jam over the base. Cream together 1 stick butter and 2/3 cup superfine sugar, then gradually mix in 3 beaten eggs. Add 1 tsp almond extract and 1½ cups ground almonds. Carefully spread this mixture over the jam and bake for about 35 minutes at 200°F, sprinkling 1 tbsp slivered almonds over the top of the tart 15 minutes before the cooking time is up. If you’re using bought jam, Wilkin &amp; Son’s Tiptree Raspberry with seeds captures the fruit’s flavor in a way that’ll make you weak at the knees. Use a seedless jam if you prefer not to spend all day digging out your molars with a fingernail, but note it’ll lack the woody contribution that the seed makes to the overall flavor, which partners so nicely with the almond.</span></span></p>

Apricot is a drupe fruit—i.e., it’s fleshy, with a seed-containing stone inside. A raspberry is an aggregation of drupelets, each tiny sphere an individual fruit containing its own dinky stone. If you can get your hands on raspberries and apricots in season, at their peak of perfumed sweetness, I can recommend nothing better than to arrange them in a bowl together and serve them at room temperature. Mediocre fruit can be redeemed by baking it, throwing the raspberries in five minutes before the apricots are cooked. Or you could make this very pretty rustic tart. Roll out some bought puff pastry to about ¼ in thick, cut out a 9-in round and place on a baking sheet lined with baking parchment. Scatter ½-in-thick slices of apricot over the pastry, leaving a ½-in margin around the edge, then dot raspberries over and sprinkle with a tablespoon or two of superfine sugar. Bake at 400°F/for about 25 minutes, until the pastry is browned. Remove and glaze with some sieved warmed apricot jam. Cool slightly and serve with a little cream or vanilla ice cream.</span></span></p>

The combination also lies at the heart of a French martini, which is made with Chambord, a liqueur containing black raspberries, herbs and honey. Put 3 tbsp vodka, 1 tbsp Chambord and 2 tbsp pineapple juice in a cocktail shaker with ice, shake, then strain into a cold martini glass.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span class="calibre5">Fresh figs are sweet, with a light berry flavor overshadowed by the heady perfume that develops when they are properly ripe. They’re very difficult to transport at this stage, so for optimal flavor you need either to live near a reliable source or to grow them yourself. Dried figs take on a much more forceful personality, with a bumped-up sweet-sour balance akin to dried apricots. Some dried figs have a sugary, fermented character, sumptuous as fortified wine; others are nuttier. I find thicker-skinned, brown dried figs can have a medicinal quality. Both fresh and dried figs are very compatible with sweet spices and with fatty, salty ingredients like blue cheese and prosciutto.</span></span></p>

Which sounds a bit like wishful thinking to me. While the best dried figs do enjoy a tantalizing and impressive range of sweet flavors—dark molasses, maple syrup, any number of honeys, maybe a little salted caramel—they’re not really the sort of flavors you find in chocolate. The only notes I can perceive in common are the sharp, red-berry flavors identifiable in ripe figs and some cocoa-rich dark chocolate.

If you can get your hands on some, eat it as you might real salami, between slices of white bread. Elsewhere in Calabria, the Italian confectioners Nicola Colavolpe make a fig and chocolate panettone with a sugared hazelnut crust; but a trip to your local Italian deli should furnish a wooden box of figs, stuffed with walnut, orange and lime zest and covered in dark chocolate.

Orange is often paired with fig, as the acidity of one tempers the sweetness of the other, and they’re seasonal partners too. Before Christmas, I make these fig and orange bars to serve with mulled wine. Simmer ½ lb chopped dried mission figs in orange juice with the zest of 1 orange for about 20 minutes, until soft. Stir in 1 tbsp butter, turn off the heat and set aside. In a food processor pulse together ½ cup self-rising flour, 1/3 cup sugar, ¼ tsp bicarbonate of soda and a pinch of salt. Add 1 stick cold butter, cut into ½-in cubes, and pulse until the mixture has a breadcrumb texture. Stir in 1 cup rolled oats. Pat down half this mixture in a buttered 8-in round pan, spoon over the fig mixture (which should be chopped or given a quick whiz in the food processor first) and then spoon the other half of the dry mix on top. Bake at 375°F for 30 minutes, until the topping has turned light brown.</span></span></p>

Rose needs balancing with bitter ingredients, such as chocolate, coffee and citrus zest, or bitter-edged spices like clove. Alternatively, use rosewater in very modest amounts for an unfathomable background note, like you might vanilla. Most rose is used in the form of rosewater, but dried rose petals and rose jam can be bought in Middle Eastern supermarkets.

On TV, a dark-haired beauty wearing too much eye makeup had only to bite into the bar to be swept onto a white Arab stallion by a chisel-jawed sheikh. I’m still partial, although just as likely these days to indulge my love of this combination by making rose ice cream with milk chocolate pieces. In a heavy-bottomed pan, gently heat 1 cup heavy cream and 1 cup milk with 4 egg yolks and ¾ cup sugar. Stir until the mixture has thickened, then strain into a bowl and stir for a minute or two longer. Cool, chill and stir in 2 tsp rosewater. Check the strength, adding a few drops until you have the right level of rosiness, bearing in mind that the freezing process will knock it back somewhat. Freeze in an ice-cream machine, adding a handful of chocolate chips after the custard has been churned but when it is still soft, before it goes into the freezer.</span></span></p>

Almost all their ices are made with rosewater. Quite a narrow business proposition, you might think, but in many Middle Eastern cuisines rose is as ubiquitous and versatile a flavor as vanilla. Mashti’s signature ice cream pairs rose with cream chips—whole pieces of frozen cream—while other varieties include a magical rosewater saffron with pistachio. Create a similar effect by freezing 2/3 cup heavy cream in a thin layer for a couple of hours, then breaking it into tiny pieces and stirring them into homemade ice cream.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span class="calibre5">Blueberries get on my nerves. It’s not entirely their fault. It’s just that all this stuff about antioxidants and phytochemicals gives them an air of piety only increased by that little flared crown they have at the top that looks like the collar of a choirboy’s cassock. Plus the white bloom on their skin reminds me of the leprous pallor of an old, sad Kit Kat (although it’s supposed to be a sign that the berries haven’t been handled too much). The flavor of blueberry is largely in its skin, so the smaller the better. If they’re a little lackluster, lure them from the path of virtue by cooking them with sugar and unlocking their aromatic potential.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span class="calibre5">Coriander seeds have a delicious citrus and balsamic character, not unlike a nice version of those scented wooden balls some people keep in their underwear drawers. They lend a startlingly pretty flavor used as the sole aromatic in cookies or to offset the bitterness of wine when you mull it—after all, their flavor recalls the classic mulling combination of orange, cinnamon and clove. Coriander seeds bring a fragrant, feminine touch to curry powder blends and pastes and to mixed pickling spices. They’re also one of the key botanicals in gin. A spare peppermill filled with roasted coriander seeds could easily get you hooked.</span></span></p>

Beat in 2 tsp lavender jelly and 1 tsp freshly ground, lightly toasted coriander seeds, then leave to cool. Whip 1¼ cups whipping cream until fairly thick and fold into the apple mix. Freeze in the usual way. Use red currant jelly if you don’t have lavender, but lavender and coriander seed have very harmonious flavors.</span></span></p>

<div class="calibre21">
 
</div>
<p><span><span class="calibre5">A universally popular fragrance and flavor. Vanilla is an orchid whose seedpods are fermented and cured to produce the flavoring. It’s native to Mexico but is now grown in Tahiti, Madagascar and Indonesia. Tahitian vanilla is highly prized for its fruity, spicy character, described by some as specifically redolent of cherry and anise. Madagascan vanilla is the type most of us are familiar with; Mexican is spicier, richer and earthier. The Incas used vanilla to flavor chocolate, and this was its exclusive culinary role until Hugh Morgan, Elizabeth I’s apothecary, began to advocate its wider application. It’s still, of course, vital to the manufacture of most chocolate, but is also the world’s favorite flavor of ice cream, an increasingly popular addition to savory dishes, and works beautifully as a background flavor in desserts and liqueurs. Pods tend to give the purest flavor but vanilla extract, powder and lovely seedy pastes are all very workable too. Natural vanilla is expensive, reflecting the labor that goes into its production, and to meet the enormous demand created by the manufacture of cakes, cookies, ice cream, candy and soft and alcoholic drinks, a synthetic form is produced in far greater quantities than vanilla itself—in fact 97 percent of vanilla flavoring consumed is synthetic. Vanillin, the main constituent of vanilla essence and extract, is the character impact compound for vanilla and was first isolated in 1858. In 1874 it became one of the first flavors to be synthesized, using material from coniferous trees. Today vanillin is extracted from clove oil, waste material from the paper and wood-pulp industry and petrochemical products. There are many who wouldn’t dream of using vanilla essence, but in blind tests conducted by </span></span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">Cook’s Illustrated</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre5">, the panel of cooks and baking experts was unable to detect much difference in custards and sponge cakes made with a range of extracts and essences. While the custard made with vanilla essence was judged to be marginally inferior, the experts preferred the fake stuff for cakes—largely on the grounds of its greater strength of flavor, probably attributable to a higher proportion of vanillin than in the extract.</span></span></p>

At the time of writing, a new 300-bottle French oak barrel costs about $700, whereas one made of American oak comes in at roughly half that. To save costs, winemakers sometimes slot new staves into older barrels whose flavor has worn out, or, even more economically, drop wood chips in nets, like giant teabags, into the vast stainless steel tanks in which many modern wines are stored. Many drinkers say the chips impart the sort of one-dimensional vanilla character found in certain sweet Chardonnays, but even high-end winemakers are resorting to, or partially incorporating, this cost-cutting measure.</span></span></p>

These days it’s not unusual to find a bay leaf panna cotta on the menus of smart restaurants. Nutmeg and vanilla come together to make a heady, almost hyper-perfumed sweetness that’s particularly irresistible in homemade custard tarts. Forget frou-frou macaroons and pretty cupcakes: custard tarts are deep, honest and intoxicating.</span></span></p>

And then my husband took me to La Cuisine de Joel Robuchon in Covent Garden and I ordered Le Sucre for dessert. Le Sucre is an iridescent, semi-transparent Christmas bauble of sugar, inflated in much the same way a glass-blower breathes sphericality into brandy balloons, filled with mascarpone and raspberry mousse and steadied on the plate by a ring of pink meringue flecked with gold leaf, on a coulis of mixed berries sprinkled with pistachio dust, next to a perfect quenelle of vanilla ice cream.

<div class="calibre21">
 
</div>
<p><span><span class="calibre5">White chocolate is made with cocoa butter, milk, sugar and vanilla, and it’s the variation in the quantity and quality of these four ingredients that accounts for what difference exists between the various bars you can buy. Vanilla is almost always by far the strongest flavor. A prominent chocolatier tells me that the possibilities for varying the flavor of white chocolate are so limited that no quality brand would offer more than one pure white chocolate bar in its product range. Cocoa butter has a strong taste but it’s not necessarily that pleasant, and nearly all chocolate manufacturers deodorize the butter in their products, even if, like pasteurization, the process suppresses some of the good flavors too. Lightly roasting the beans can get around the problem. That said, the Venezuelan chocolate makers El Rey don’t deodorize, and their bar made with 34 percent cocoa butter is often said to be the best tasting on the market. It’s less sweet than most white chocolate, and more potently chocolatey. Green and Black’s white chocolate is shot through with lots of vanilla seeds and tastes like a sweet but luxurious vanilla ice cream, with hints of strawberry and apricot brandy that recall how white chocolate can benefit from sour balancing flavors. </span></span></p>

Almonds, especially roasted, can diffuse its sweetness, as Nestlé may have had in mind when it included them in North America’s first white chocolate bar, launched in the 1940s. Combine them yourself and you can both increase the nut content and use your preferred white chocolate. Roast 1 cup blanched almonds in the oven at 350°F for 8–10 minutes, until lightly browned, then set aside. Line a baking tray with baking parchment. Put 7 oz white chocolate in a bowl set over (but not touching) a pan of simmering water. When it’s completely melted, stir in the nuts, then spread the mixture over the baking parchment. Bear in mind that you’ll be breaking it into chunky pieces, so don’t spread it too thin. Let it cool a little, then chill until set. In the States this is known as bark. You could throw some dried sour cherries in too, to give your bark some bite.</span></span></p>

Vanilla is white chocolate’s primary flavor. Which makes me think that when a decent dark or milk chocolate is combined with white (in a dark chocolate truffle, say, with a white chocolate coating), thereby upping its vanilla content while diluting its cocoa solids, the darker chocolate is essentially being cheapened. It’s like adding a blended whisky to your single malt. </span></span></p>

<p><span><span class="calibre5">Niki Segnit had not so much as peeled a potato until her early twenties when, almost by accident, she discovered that she loved cooking. As much as she enjoys haute cuisine, she’s not likely to attempt to reproduce it at home, preferring to experiment with recipes from domestic kitchens abroad. Her background is in marketing, specializing in food and drink, and she has worked with many famous brands of candy, snacks, baby foods, condiments, dairy products, hard liquors and soft drinks. She lives in central London with her husband.</span></span></p>
